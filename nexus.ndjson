{"page": 12, "content": "Prologue\nW\ne have named our species Homo sapiens\u2014the wise human. But it is\ndebatable how well we have lived up to the name.\nOver the last 100,000 years, we Sapiens have certainly accumulated\nenormous power. Just listing all our discoveries, inventions, and conquests\nwould fill volumes. But power isn\u2019t wisdom, and after 100,000 years of\ndiscoveries, inventions, and conquests humanity has pushed itself into an\nexistential crisis. We are on the verge of ecological collapse, caused by the\nmisuse of our own power. We are also busy creating new technologies like\nartificial intelligence (AI) that have the potential to escape our control and\nenslave or annihilate us. Yet instead of our species uniting to deal with these\nexistential challenges, international tensions are rising, global cooperation\nis becoming more difficult, countries are stockpiling doomsday weapons,\nand a new world war does not seem impossible.\nIf we Sapiens are so wise, why are we so self-destructive?\nAt a deeper level, although we have accumulated so much information\nabout everything from DNA molecules to distant galaxies, it doesn\u2019t seem\nthat all this information has given us an answer to the big questions of life:\nWho are we? What should we aspire to? What is a good life, and how\nshould we live it? Despite the stupendous amounts of information at our\ndisposal, we are as susceptible as our ancient ancestors to fantasy and\ndelusion. Nazism and Stalinism are but two recent examples of the mass\ninsanity that occasionally engulfs even modern societies. Nobody disputes\nthat humans today have a lot more information and power than in the Stone\nAge, but it is far from certain that we understand ourselves and our role in\nthe universe much better."}
{"page": 13, "content": "Why are we so good at accumulating more information and power, but far\nless successful at acquiring wisdom? Throughout history many traditions\nhave believed that some fatal flaw in our nature tempts us to pursue powers\nwe don\u2019t know how to handle. The Greek myth of Phaethon told of a boy\nwho discovers that he is the son of Helios, the sun god. Wishing to prove\nhis divine origin, Phaethon demands the privilege of driving the chariot of\nthe sun. Helios warns Phaethon that no human can control the celestial\nhorses that pull the solar chariot. But Phaethon insists, until the sun god\nrelents. After rising proudly in the sky, Phaethon indeed loses control of the\nchariot. The sun veers off course, scorching all vegetation, killing numerous\nbeings, and threatening to burn the earth itself. Zeus intervenes and strikes\nPhaethon with a thunderbolt. The conceited human drops from the sky like\na falling star, himself on fire. The gods reassert control of the sky and save\nthe world.\nTwo thousand years later, when the Industrial Revolution was making its\nfirst steps and machines began replacing humans in numerous tasks, Johann\nWolfgang von Goethe published a similar cautionary tale titled \u201cThe\nSorcerer\u2019s Apprentice.\u201d Goethe\u2019s poem (later popularized as a Walt Disney\nanimation starring Mickey Mouse) tells how an old sorcerer leaves a young\napprentice in charge of his workshop and gives him some chores to tend to\nwhile he is gone, like fetching water from the river. The apprentice decides\nto make things easier for himself and, using one of the sorcerer\u2019s spells,\nenchants a broom to fetch the water for him. But the apprentice doesn\u2019t\nknow how to stop the broom, which relentlessly fetches more and more\nwater, threatening to flood the workshop. In panic, the apprentice cuts the\nenchanted broom in two with an ax, only to see each half become another\nbroom. Now two enchanted brooms are inundating the workshop with\nwater. When the old sorcerer returns, the apprentice pleads for help: \u201cThe\nspirits that I summoned, I now cannot rid myself of again.\u201d The sorcerer\nimmediately breaks the spell and stops the flood. The lesson to the\napprentice\u2014and to humanity\u2014is clear: never summon powers you cannot"}
{"page": 14, "content": "control.\nWhat do the cautionary fables of the apprentice and of Phaethon tell us in\nthe twenty-first century? We humans have obviously refused to heed their\nwarnings. We have already driven the earth\u2019s climate out of balance and\nhave summoned billions of enchanted brooms, drones, chatbots, and other\nalgorithmic spirits that may escape our control and unleash a flood of\nunintended consequences.\nWhat should we do, then? The fables offer no answers, other than to wait\nfor some god or sorcerer to save us. This, of course, is an extremely\ndangerous message. It encourages people to abdicate responsibility and put\ntheir faith in gods and sorcerers instead. Even worse, it fails to appreciate\nthat gods and sorcerers are themselves a human invention\u2014just like\nchariots, brooms, and algorithms. The tendency to create powerful things\nwith unintended consequences started not with the invention of the steam\nengine or AI but with the invention of religion. Prophets and theologians\nhave repeatedly summoned powerful spirits that were supposed to bring\nlove and joy but ended up flooding the world with blood.\nThe Phaethon myth and Goethe\u2019s poem fail to provide useful advice\nbecause they misconstrue the way humans gain power. In both fables, a\nsingle human acquires enormous power, but is then corrupted by hubris and\ngreed. The conclusion is that our flawed individual psychology makes us\nabuse power. What this crude analysis misses is that human power is never\nthe outcome of individual initiative. Power always stems from cooperation\nbetween large numbers of humans.\nAccordingly, it isn\u2019t our individual psychology that causes us to abuse\npower. After all, alongside greed, hubris, and cruelty, humans are also\ncapable of love, compassion, humility, and joy. True, among the worst\nmembers of our species, greed and cruelty reign supreme and lead bad\nactors to abuse power. But why would human societies choose to entrust\npower to their worst members? Most Germans in 1933, for example, were\nnot psychopaths. So why did they vote for Hitler?"}
{"page": 15, "content": "Our tendency to summon powers we cannot control stems not from\nindividual psychology but from the unique way our species cooperates in\nlarge numbers. The main argument of this book is that humankind gains\nenormous power by building large networks of cooperation, but the way\nthese networks are built predisposes them to use power unwisely. Our\nproblem, then, is a network problem.\nEven more specifically, it is an information problem. Information is the\nglue that holds networks together. But for tens of thousands of years,\nSapiens built and maintained large networks by inventing and spreading\nfictions, fantasies, and mass delusions\u2014about gods, about enchanted\nbroomsticks, about AI, and about a great many other things. While each\nindividual human is typically interested in knowing the truth about\nthemselves and the world, large networks bind members and create order by\nrelying on fictions and fantasies. That\u2019s how we got, for example, to\nNazism and Stalinism. These were exceptionally powerful networks, held\ntogether by exceptionally deluded ideas. As George Orwell famously put it,\nignorance is strength.\nThe fact that the Nazi and Stalinist regimes were founded on cruel\nfantasies and shameless lies did not make them historically exceptional, nor\ndid it preordain them to collapse. Nazism and Stalinism were two of the\nstrongest networks humans ever created. In late 1941 and early 1942, the\nAxis powers came within reach of winning World War II. Stalin eventually\nemerged as the victor of that war,1 and in the 1950s and 1960s he and his\nheirs also had a reasonable chance of winning the Cold War. By the 1990s\nliberal democracies had gained the upper hand, but this now seems like a\ntemporary victory. In the twenty-first century, some new totalitarian regime\nmay well succeed where Hitler and Stalin failed, creating an all-powerful\nnetwork that could prevent future generations from even attempting to\nexpose its lies and fictions. We should not assume that delusional networks\nare doomed to failure. If we want to prevent their triumph, we will have to\ndo the hard work ourselves."}
{"page": 16, "content": "THE NAIVE VIEW OF INFORMATION\nIt is difficult to appreciate the strength of delusional networks because of a\nbroader misunderstanding about how big information networks\u2014whether\ndelusional or not\u2014operate. This misunderstanding is encapsulated in\nsomething I call \u201cthe naive view of information.\u201d While fables like the\nmyth of Phaethon and \u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice\u201d present an overly\npessimistic view of individual human psychology, the naive view of\ninformation disseminates an overly optimistic view of large-scale human\nnetworks.\nThe naive view argues that by gathering and processing much more\ninformation than individuals can, big networks achieve a better\nunderstanding of medicine, physics, economics, and numerous other fields,\nwhich makes the network not only powerful but also wise. For example, by\ngathering information on pathogens, pharmaceutical companies and health-\ncare services can determine the true causes of many diseases, which enables\nthem to develop more effective medicines and to make wiser decisions\nabout their usage. This view posits that in sufficient quantities information\nleads to truth, and truth in turn leads to both power and wisdom. Ignorance,\nin contrast, seems to lead nowhere. While delusional or deceitful networks\nmight occasionally arise in moments of historical crisis, in the long term\nthey are bound to lose to more clear-sighted and honest rivals. A health-care\nservice that ignores information about pathogens, or a pharmaceutical giant\nthat deliberately spreads disinformation, will ultimately lose out to\ncompetitors that make wiser use of information. The naive view thus\nimplies that delusional networks must be aberrations and that big networks\ncan usually be trusted to handle power wisely."}
{"page": 17, "content": "The naive view of information\nOf course, the naive view acknowledges that many things can go wrong\non the path from information to truth. We might make honest mistakes in\ngathering and processing the information. Malicious actors motivated by\ngreed or hate might hide important facts or try to deceive us. As a result,\ninformation sometimes leads to error rather than truth. For example, partial\ninformation, faulty analysis, or a disinformation campaign might lead even\nexperts to misidentify the true cause of a particular disease.\nHowever, the naive view assumes that the antidote to most problems we\nencounter in gathering and processing information is gathering and\nprocessing even more information. While we are never completely safe\nfrom error, in most cases more information means greater accuracy. A single\ndoctor wishing to identify the cause of an epidemic by examining a single\npatient is less likely to succeed than thousands of doctors gathering data on\nmillions of patients. And if the doctors themselves conspire to hide the\ntruth, making medical information more freely available to the public and to\ninvestigative journalists will eventually reveal the scam. According to this\nview, the bigger the information network, the closer it must be to the truth.\nNaturally, even if we analyze information accurately and discover\nimportant truths, this does not guarantee we will use the resulting\ncapabilities wisely. Wisdom is commonly understood to mean \u201cmaking\nright decisions,\u201d but what \u201cright\u201d means depends on value judgments that\ndiffer between diverse people, cultures, or ideologies. Scientists who\ndiscover a new pathogen may develop a vaccine to protect people. But if\nthe scientists\u2014or their political overlords\u2014believe in a racist ideology that\nadvocates that some races are inferior and should be exterminated, the new\nmedical knowledge might be used to develop a biological weapon that kills"}
{"page": 18, "content": "millions.\nIn this case too, the naive view of information holds that additional\ninformation offers at least a partial remedy. The naive view thinks that\ndisagreements about values turn out on closer inspection to be the fault of\neither the lack of information or deliberate disinformation. According to this\nview, racists are ill-informed people who just don\u2019t know the facts of\nbiology and history. They think that \u201crace\u201d is a valid biological category,\nand they have been brainwashed by bogus conspiracy theories. The remedy\nto racism is therefore to provide people with more biological and historical\nfacts. It may take time, but in a free market of information sooner or later\ntruth will prevail.\nThe naive view is of course more nuanced and thoughtful than can be\nexplained in a few paragraphs, but its core tenet is that information is an\nessentially good thing, and the more we have of it, the better. Given enough\ninformation and enough time, we are bound to discover the truth about\nthings ranging from viral infections to racist biases, thereby developing not\nonly our power but also the wisdom necessary to use that power well.\nThis naive view justifies the pursuit of ever more powerful information\ntechnologies and has been the semiofficial ideology of the computer age\nand the internet. In June 1989, a few months before the fall of the Berlin\nWall and of the Iron Curtain, Ronald Reagan declared that \u201cthe Goliath of\ntotalitarian control will rapidly be brought down by the David of the\nmicrochip\u201d and that \u201cthe biggest of Big Brothers is increasingly helpless\nagainst communications technology.\u2026 Information is the oxygen of the\nmodern age.\u2026 It seeps through the walls topped with barbed wire. It wafts\nacross the electrified, booby-trapped borders. Breezes of electronic beams\nblow through the Iron Curtain as if it was lace.\u201d2 In November 2009, Barack\nObama spoke in the same spirit on a visit to Shanghai, telling his Chinese\nhosts, \u201cI am a big believer in technology and I\u2019m a big believer in openness\nwhen it comes to the flow of information. I think that the more freely\ninformation flows, the stronger the society becomes.\u201d3"}
{"page": 19, "content": "Entrepreneurs and corporations have often expressed similarly rosy views\nof information technology. Already in 1858 an editorial in The New\nEnglander about the invention of the telegraph stated, \u201cIt is impossible that\nold prejudices and hostilities should longer exist, while such an instrument\nhas been created for an exchange of thought between all the nations of the\nearth.\u201d4 Nearly two centuries and two world wars later, Mark Zuckerberg\nsaid that Facebook\u2019s goal \u201cis to help people to share more in order to make\nthe world more open and to help promote understanding between people.\u201d5\nIn his 2024 book, The Singularity Is Nearer, the eminent futurologist and\nentrepreneur Ray Kurzweil surveys the history of information technology\nand concludes that \u201cthe reality is that nearly every aspect of life is getting\nprogressively better as a result of exponentially improving technology.\u201d\nLooking back at the grand sweep of human history, he cites examples like\nthe invention of the printing press to argue that by its very nature\ninformation technology tends to spawn \u201ca virtuous circle advancing nearly\nevery aspect of human well-being, including literacy, education, wealth,\nsanitation, health, democratization and reduction in violence.\u201d6\nThe naive view of information is perhaps most succinctly captured in\nGoogle\u2019s mission statement \u201cto organize the world\u2019s information and make\nit universally accessible and useful.\u201d Google\u2019s answer to Goethe\u2019s warnings\nis that while a single apprentice pilfering his master\u2019s secret spell book is\nlikely to cause disaster, when a lot of apprentices are given free access to all\nthe world\u2019s information, they will not only create useful enchanted brooms\nbut also learn to handle them wisely.\nGOOGLE VERSUS GOETHE\nIt must be stressed that there are numerous cases when having more\ninformation has indeed enabled humans to understand the world better and\nto make wiser use of their power.

{"page": 20, "content": "reduction in child mortality. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was the eldest of\nseven siblings, but only he and his sister Cornelia got to celebrate their\nseventh birthday. Disease carried off their brother Hermann Jacob at age\nsix, their sister Catharina Elisabeth at age four, their sister Johanna Maria at\nage two, their brother Georg Adolf at age eight months, and a fifth,\nunnamed brother was stillborn. Cornelia then died from disease aged\ntwenty-six, leaving Johann Wolfgang as the sole survivor from their family.7\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe went on to have five children of his own, of\nwhom all but the eldest son\u2014August\u2014died within two weeks of their birth.\nIn all probability the cause was incompatibility between the blood groups of\nGoethe and his wife, Christiane, which after the first successful pregnancy\nled the mother to develop antibodies to the fetal blood. This condition,\nknown as rhesus disease, is nowadays treated so effectively that the\nmortality rate is less than 2 percent, but in the 1790s it had an average\nmortality rate of 50 percent, and for Goethe\u2019s four younger children it was a\ndeath sentence.8\nAltogether in the Goethe family\u2014a well-to-do German family in the late\neighteenth century\u2014the child survival rate was an abysmal 25 percent.\nOnly three out of twelve children reached adulthood. This horrendous\nstatistic was not exceptional. Around the time Goethe wrote \u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s\nApprentice\u201d in 1797, it is estimated that only about 50 percent of German\nchildren reached age fifteen,9 and the same was probably true in most other\nparts of the world.10 By 2020, 95.6 percent of children worldwide lived\nbeyond their fifteenth birthday,11 and in Germany that figure was 99.5\npercent.12 This momentous achievement would not have been possible\nwithout collecting, analyzing, and sharing massive amounts of medical data\nabout things like blood groups. In this case, then, the naive view of\ninformation proved to be correct.\nHowever, the naive view of information sees only part of the picture, and\nthe history of the modern age was not just about reducing child mortality.

Every\nsmartphone contains more information than the ancient Library of\nAlexandria13 and enables its owner to instantaneously connect to billions of\nother people throughout the world. Yet with all this information circulating\nat breathtaking speeds, humanity is closer than ever to annihilating itself.\nDespite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014our hoard of data, we are continuing to\nspew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, pollute rivers and oceans, cut\ndown forests, destroy entire habitats, drive countless species to extinction,\nand jeopardize the ecological foundations of our own species. We are also\nproducing ever more powerful weapons of mass destruction, from\nthermonuclear bombs to doomsday viruses. Our leaders don\u2019t lack\ninformation about these dangers, yet instead of collaborating to find\nsolutions, they are edging closer to a global war.\nWould having even more information make things better\u2014or worse? We\nwill soon find out. Numerous corporations and governments are in a race to\ndevelop the most powerful information technology in history\u2014AI. Some\nleading entrepreneurs, like the American investor Marc Andreessen, believe\nthat AI will finally solve all of humanity\u2019s problems. On June 6, 2023,\nAndreessen published an essay titled \u201cWhy AI Will Save the World,\u201d\npeppered with bold statements like \u201cI am here to bring the good news: AI\nwill not destroy the world, and in fact may save it\u201d and \u201cAI can make\neverything we care about better.\u201d He concluded, \u201cThe development and\nproliferation of AI\u2014far from a risk that we should fear\u2014is a moral\nobligation that we have to ourselves, to our children, and to our future.\u201d14\nRay Kurzweil concurs, arguing in The Singularity Is Nearer that \u201cAI is the\npivotal technology that will allow us to meet the pressing challenges that\nconfront us, including overcoming disease, poverty, environmental\ndegradation, and all of our human frailties. We have a moral imperative to\nrealize this promise of new technologies.\u201d Kurzweil is keenly aware of the\ntechnology\u2019s potential perils, and analyzes them at length, but believes they\ncould be mitigated successfully.15"}
{"page": 22, "content": "Others are more skeptical. Not only philosophers and social scientists but\nalso many leading AI experts and entrepreneurs like Yoshua Bengio,\nGeoffrey Hinton, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Mustafa Suleyman have\nwarned the public that AI could destroy our civilization.16 A 2024 article co-\nauthored by Bengio, Hinton, and numerous other experts noted that\n\u201cunchecked AI advancement could culminate in a large-scale loss of life\nand the biosphere, and the marginalization or even extinction of\nhumanity.\u201d17 In a 2023 survey of 2,778 AI researchers, more than a third\ngave at least a 10 percent chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad\nas human extinction.18 In 2023 close to thirty governments\u2014including those\nof China, the United States, and the U.K.\u2014signed the Bletchley Declaration\non AI, which acknowledged that \u201cthere is potential for serious, even\ncatastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the\nmost significant capabilities of these AI models.\u201d19 By using such\napocalyptic terms, experts and governments have no wish to conjure a\nHollywood image of killer robots running in the streets and shooting\npeople. Such a scenario is unlikely, and it merely distracts people from the\nreal dangers. Rather, experts warn about two other scenarios.\nFirst, the power of AI could supercharge existing human conflicts,\ndividing humanity against itself. Just as in the twentieth century the Iron\nCurtain divided the rival powers in the Cold War, so in the twenty-first\ncentury the Silicon Curtain\u2014made of silicon chips and computer codes\nrather than barbed wire\u2014might come to divide rival powers in a new global\nconflict.

People who\nsingle out China, Russia, or a post-democratic United States as their main\nsource for totalitarian nightmares misunderstand the danger. In fact,\nChinese, Russians, Americans, and all other humans are together threatened\nby the totalitarian potential of nonhuman intelligence.\nGiven the magnitude of the danger, AI should be of interest to all human\nbeings. While not everyone can become an AI expert, we should all keep in\nmind that AI is the first technology in history that can make decisions and\ncreate new ideas by itself. All previous human inventions have empowered\nhumans, because no matter how powerful the new tool was, the decisions\nabout its usage always remained in our hands. Knives and bombs do not\nthemselves decide whom to kill. They are dumb tools, lacking the\nintelligence necessary to process information and make independent\ndecisions. In contrast, AI has the required intelligence to process\ninformation by itself, and therefore replace humans in decision making.\nIts mastery of information also enables AI to independently generate new\nideas, in fields ranging from music to medicine. Gramophones played our\nmusic, and microscopes revealed the secrets of our cells, but gramophones\ncouldn\u2019t compose new symphonies, and microscopes couldn\u2019t synthesize\nnew drugs.

This trend will only\nincrease and accelerate, making it more difficult to understand our own\nlives. Can we trust computer algorithms to make wise decisions and create a\nbetter world?

AI could alter the course not just of our species\u2019 history but of the\nevolution of all life-forms.\nWEAPONIZING INFORMATION\nIn 2016, I published Homo Deus, a book that highlighted some of the\ndangers posed to humanity by the new information technologies. That book\nargued that the real hero of history has always been information, rather than\nHomo sapiens, and that scientists increasingly understand not just history\nbut also biology, politics, and economics in terms of information flows.\nAnimals, states, and markets are all information networks, absorbing data\nfrom the environment, making decisions, and releasing data back. The book\nwarned that while we hope better information technology will give us\nhealth, happiness, and power, it may actually take power away from us and\ndestroy both our physical and our mental health. Homo Deus hypothesized\nthat if humans aren\u2019t careful, we might dissolve within the torrent of\ninformation like a clump of earth within a gushing river, and that in the\ngrand scheme of things humanity will turn out to have been just a ripple\nwithin the cosmic dataflow.\nIn the years since Homo Deus was published, the pace of change has only\naccelerated, and power has indeed been shifting from humans to algorithms.\nMany of the scenarios that sounded like science fiction in 2016\u2014such as\nalgorithms that can create art, masquerade as human beings, make crucial\nlife decisions about us, and know more about us than we know about\nourselves\u2014are everyday realities in 2024.\nMany other things have changed since 2016.

These radical\ncritiques occasionally went as far as arguing that \u201cscientific facts\u201d are\nnothing more than a capitalist or colonialist \u201cdiscourse\u201d and that people in\npower can never be really interested in truth and can never be trusted to\nrecognize and correct their own mistakes.22\nThis particular line of radical leftist thinking goes back to Karl Marx, who\nargued in the mid-nineteenth century that power is the only reality, that\ninformation is a weapon, and that elites who claim to be serving truth and\njustice are in fact pursuing narrow class privileges. In the words of the 1848\nCommunist Manifesto, \u201cThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the\nhistory of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord\nand serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed\nstood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted,\nnow hidden, now open, fight.\u201d This binary interpretation of history implies\nthat every human interaction is a power struggle between oppressors and\noppressed. Accordingly, whenever anyone says anything, the question to\nask isn\u2019t, \u201cWhat is being said? Is it true?\u201d but rather, \u201cWho is saying this?\nWhose privileges does it serve?\u201d\nOf course, right-wing populists such as Trump and Bolsonaro are unlikely\nto have read Foucault or Marx, and indeed present themselves as fiercely\nanti-Marxist. They also greatly differ from Marxists in their suggested\npolicies in fields like taxation and welfare. But their basic view of society\nand of information is surprisingly Marxist, seeing all human interactions as\na power struggle between oppressors and oppressed. For example, in his\ninaugural address in 2017 Trump announced that \u201ca small group in our\nnation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people\nhave borne the cost.\u201d23 Such rhetoric is a staple of populism, which the\npolitical scientist Cas Mudde has described as an \u201cideology that considers"}

If power is\nthe only reality, and if information is just a weapon, what does it imply\nabout the populists themselves? Are they too interested only in power, and\nare they too lying to us to gain power?\nPopulists have sought to extricate themselves from this conundrum in two\ndifferent ways. Some populist movements claim adherence to the ideals of\nmodern science and to the traditions of skeptical empiricism. They tell\npeople that indeed you should never trust any institutions or figures of\nauthority\u2014including self-proclaimed populist parties and politicians.\nInstead, you should \u201cdo your own research\u201d and trust only what you can\ndirectly observe by yourself.25 This radical empiricist position implies that\nwhile large-scale institutions like political parties, courts, newspapers, and\nuniversities can never be trusted, individuals who make the effort can still\nfind the truth by themselves.\nThis approach may sound scientific and may appeal to free-spirited\nindividuals, but it leaves open the question of how human communities can\ncooperate to build health-care systems or pass environmental regulations,\nwhich demand large-scale institutional organization. Is a single individual\ncapable of doing all the necessary research to decide whether the earth\u2019s\nclimate is heating up and what should be done about it? How would a single\nperson go about collecting climate data from throughout the world, not to\nmention obtaining reliable records from past centuries?

{"page": 28, "content": "that there is no objective truth. As we shall see in chapter 4, science is a\ncollaborative institutional effort rather than a personal quest.\nAn alternative populist solution is to abandon the modern scientific ideal\nof finding the truth via \u201cresearch\u201d and instead go back to relying on divine\nrevelation or mysticism. Traditional religions like Christianity, Islam, and\nHinduism have typically characterized humans as untrustworthy power-\nhungry creatures who can access the truth only thanks to the intervention of\na divine intelligence. In the 2010s and early 2020s populist parties from\nBrazil to Turkey and from the United States to India have aligned\nthemselves with such traditional religions. They have expressed radical\ndoubt about modern institutions while declaring complete faith in ancient\nscriptures. The populists claim that the articles you read in The New York\nTimes or in Science are just an elitist ploy to gain power, but what you read\nin the Bible, the Quran, or the Vedas is absolute truth.26\nA variation on this theme calls on people to put their trust in charismatic\nleaders like Trump and Bolsonaro, who are depicted by their supporters\neither as the messengers of God27 or as possessing a mystical bond with\n\u201cthe people.\u201d While ordinary politicians lie to the people in order to gain\npower for themselves, the charismatic leader is the infallible mouthpiece of\nthe people who exposes all the lies.28 One of the recurrent paradoxes of\npopulism is that it starts by warning us that all human elites are driven by a\ndangerous hunger for power, but often ends by entrusting all power to a\nsingle ambitious human.\nWe will explore populism at greater depth in chapter 5, but at this point it\nis important to note that populists are eroding trust in large-scale institutions\nand international cooperation just when humanity confronts the existential\nchallenges of ecological collapse, global war, and out-of-control\ntechnology. Instead of trusting complex human institutions, populists give\nus the same advice as the Phaethon myth and \u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice\u201d:\n\u201cTrust God or the great sorcerer to intervene and make everything right\nagain.\u201d If we take this advice, we\u2019ll likely find ourselves in the short term"}

Or we might find ourselves\nnowhere at all, as Earth becomes inhospitable for human life.\nIf we wish to avoid relinquishing power to a charismatic leader or an\ninscrutable AI, we must first gain a better understanding of what\ninformation is, how it helps to build human networks, and how it relates to\ntruth and power. Populists are right to be suspicious of the naive view of\ninformation, but they are wrong to think that power is the only reality and\nthat information is always a weapon. Information isn\u2019t the raw material of\ntruth, but it isn\u2019t a mere weapon, either. There is enough space between\nthese extremes for a more nuanced and hopeful view of human information\nnetworks and of our ability to handle power wisely. This book is dedicated\nto exploring that middle ground.\nTHE ROAD AHEAD\nThe first part of this book surveys the historical development of human\ninformation networks. It doesn\u2019t attempt to present a comprehensive\ncentury-by-century account of information technologies like script, printing\npresses, and radio. Instead, by studying a few examples, it explores key\ndilemmas that people in all eras faced when trying to construct information\nnetworks, and it examines how different answers to these dilemmas shaped\ncontrasting human societies. What we usually think of as ideological and\npolitical conflicts often turn out to be clashes between opposing types of\ninformation networks.\nPart 1 begins by examining two principles that have been essential for\nlarge-scale human information networks: mythology and bureaucracy.\nChapters 2 and 3 describe how large-scale information networks\u2014from\nancient kingdoms to present-day states\u2014have relied on both mythmakers\nand bureaucrats. The stories of the Bible, for example, were essential for the"}
{"page": 30, "content": "Christian Church, but there would have been no Bible if church bureaucrats\nhadn\u2019t curated, edited, and disseminated these stories. A difficult dilemma\nfor every human network is that mythmakers and bureaucrats tend to pull in\ndifferent directions. Institutions and societies are often defined by the\nbalance they manage to find between the conflicting needs of their\nmythmakers and their bureaucrats. The Christian Church itself split into\nrival churches, like the Catholic and Protestant churches, which struck\ndifferent balances between mythology and bureaucracy.\nChapter 4 then focuses on the problem of erroneous information and on\nthe benefits and drawbacks of maintaining self-correcting mechanisms,\nsuch as independent courts or peer-reviewed journals. The chapter contrasts\ninstitutions that relied on weak self-correcting mechanisms, like the\nCatholic Church, with institutions that developed strong self-correcting\nmechanisms, like scientific disciplines. Weak self-correcting mechanisms\nsometimes result in historical calamities like the early modern European\nwitch hunts, while strong self-correcting mechanisms sometimes destabilize\nthe network from within. Judged in terms of longevity, spread, and power,\nthe Catholic Church has been perhaps the most successful institution in\nhuman history, despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014the relative weakness of\nits self-correcting mechanisms.\nAfter part 1 surveys the roles of mythology and bureaucracy, and the\ncontrast between strong and weak self-correcting mechanisms, chapter 5\nconcludes the historical discussion by focusing on another contrast\u2014\nbetween distributed and centralized information networks. Democratic\nsystems allow information to flow freely along many independent channels,\nwhereas totalitarian systems strive to concentrate information in one hub.\nEach choice has both advantages and shortcomings. Understanding political\nsystems like the United States and the U.S.S.R. in terms of information\nflows can explain much about their differing trajectories.\nThis historical part of the book is crucial for understanding present-day\ndevelopments and future scenarios.

History isn\u2019t the study of the past; it is the\nstudy of change. History teaches us what remains the same, what changes,\nand how things change. This is as relevant to information revolutions as to\nevery other kind of historical transformation. Thus, understanding the\nprocess through which the allegedly infallible Bible was canonized provides\nvaluable insight about present-day claims for AI infallibility. Similarly,\nstudying the early modern witch hunts and Stalin\u2019s collectivization offers\nstark warnings about what might go wrong as we give AIs greater control\nover twenty-first-century societies. A deep knowledge of history is also vital\nto understand what is new about AI, how it is fundamentally different from\nprinting presses and radio sets, and in what specific ways future AI\ndictatorship could be very unlike anything we have seen before.\nThe book doesn\u2019t argue that studying the past enables us to predict the\nfuture. As emphasized repeatedly in the following pages, history is not\ndeterministic, and the future will be shaped by the choices we all make in\ncoming years. The whole point of writing this book is that by making\ninformed choices, we can prevent the worst outcomes.

As noted above, history isn\u2019t deterministic, and for at least a few\nmore years we Sapiens still have the power to shape our future.\nAccordingly, chapter 9 explores how democracies might deal with the\ninorganic network. How, for example, can flesh-and-blood politicians make\nfinancial decisions if the financial system is increasingly controlled by AI\nand the very meaning of money comes to depend on inscrutable algorithms?\nHow can democracies maintain a public conversation about anything\u2014be it\nfinance or gender\u2014if we can no longer know whether we are talking with\nanother human or with a chatbot masquerading as a human?\nChapter 10 explores the potential impact of the inorganic network on\ntotalitarianism.

{"page": 35, "content": "CHAPTER 1\nWhat Is Information?\nI\nt is always tricky to define fundamental concepts. Since they are the\nbasis for everything that follows, they themselves seem to lack any basis\nof their own. Physicists have a hard time defining matter and energy,\nbiologists have a hard time defining life, and philosophers have a hard time\ndefining reality.\nInformation is increasingly seen by many philosophers and biologists, and\neven by some physicists, as the most basic building block of reality, more\nelementary than matter and energy.1 No wonder that there are many disputes\nabout how to define information, and how it is related to the evolution of\nlife or to basic ideas in physics such as entropy, the laws of\nthermodynamics, and the quantum uncertainty principle.2 This book will\nmake no attempt to resolve\u2014or even explain\u2014these disputes, nor will it\noffer a universal definition of information applicable to physics, biology,\nand all other fields of knowledge. Since it is a work of history, which\nstudies the past and future development of human societies, it will focus on\nthe definition and role of information in history.\nIn everyday usage, information is associated with human-made symbols\nlike spoken or written words. Consider, for example, the story of Cher Ami\nand the Lost Battalion. In October 1918, when the American Expeditionary\nForces was fighting to liberate northern France from the Germans, a\nbattalion of more than five hundred American soldiers was trapped behind\nenemy lines. American artillery, which was trying to provide them with"}

The battalion\u2019s commander, Major Charles Whittlesey, urgently\nneeded to inform headquarters of his true location, but no runner could\nbreak through the German line. According to several accounts, as a last\nresort Whittlesey turned to Cher Ami, an army carrier pigeon. On a tiny\npiece of paper, Whittlesey wrote, \u201cWe are along the road paralell [sic]\n276.4. Our artillery is dropping a barrage directly on us. For heaven\u2019s sake\nstop it.\u201d The paper was inserted into a canister on Cher Ami\u2019s right leg, and\nthe bird was released into the air. One of the battalion\u2019s soldiers, Private\nJohn Nell, recalled years later, \u201cWe knew without a doubt this was our last\nchance. If that one lonely, scared pigeon failed to find its loft, our fate was\nsealed.\u201d\nWitnesses later described how Cher Ami flew into heavy German fire. A\nshell exploded directly below the bird, killing five men and severely\ninjuring the pigeon. A splinter tore through Cher Ami\u2019s chest, and his right\nleg was left hanging by a tendon. But he got through. The wounded pigeon\nflew the forty kilometers to division headquarters in about forty-five\nminutes, with the canister containing the crucial message attached to the\nremnant of his right leg. Though there is some controversy about the exact\ndetails, it is clear that the American artillery adjusted its barrage, and an\nAmerican counterattack rescued the Lost Battalion. Cher Ami was tended\nby army medics, sent to the United States as a hero, and became the subject\nof numerous articles, short stories, children\u2019s books, poems, and even\nmovies. The pigeon had no idea what information he was conveying, but\nthe symbols inked on the piece of paper he carried helped save hundreds of\nmen from death and captivity.3\nInformation, however, does not have to consist of human-made symbols.\nAccording to the biblical myth of the Flood, Noah learned that the water\nhad finally receded because the pigeon he sent out from the ark returned\nwith an olive branch in her mouth. Then God set a rainbow in the clouds as\na heavenly record of his promise never to flood the earth again. Pigeons,"}
{"page": 37, "content": "olive branches, and rainbows have since become iconic symbols of peace\nand tolerance. Objects that are even more remote than rainbows can also be\ninformation. For astronomers the shape and movement of galaxies\nconstitute crucial information about the history of the universe. For\nnavigators the North Star indicates which way is north. For astrologers the\nstars are a cosmic script, conveying information about the future of\nindividual humans and entire societies.\nOf course, defining something as \u201cinformation\u201d is a matter of perspective.\nAn astronomer or astrologer might view the Libra constellation as\n\u201cinformation,\u201d but these distant stars are far more than just a notice board\nfor human observers. There might be an alien civilization up there, totally\noblivious to the information we glean from their home and to the stories we\ntell about it. Similarly, a piece of paper marked with ink splotches can be\ncrucial information for an army unit, or dinner for a family of termites. Any\nobject can be information\u2014or not. This makes it difficult to define what\ninformation is.\nThe ambivalence of information has played an important role in the annals\nof military espionage, when spies needed to communicate information\nsurreptitiously. During World War I, northern France was not the only major\nbattleground. From 1915 to 1918 the British and Ottoman Empires fought\nfor control of the Middle East. After repulsing an Ottoman attack on the\nSinai Peninsula and the Suez Canal, the British in turn invaded the Ottoman\nEmpire, but were held at bay until October 1917 by a fortified Ottoman line\nstretching from Beersheba to Gaza. British attempts to break through were\nrepulsed at the First Battle of Gaza (March 26, 1917) and the Second Battle\nof Gaza (April 17\u201319, 1917). Meanwhile, pro-British Jews living in\nPalestine set up a spy network code-named NILI to inform the British about\nOttoman troop movements. One method they developed to communicate\nwith their British operators involved window shutters. Sarah Aaronsohn, a\nNILI commander, had a house overlooking the Mediterranean. She signaled\nBritish ships by closing or opening a particular shutter, according to a"}
{"page": 38, "content": "predetermined code. Numerous people, including Ottoman soldiers, could\nobviously see the shutter, but nobody other than NILI agents and their\nBritish operators understood it was vital military information.4 So, when is\na shutter just a shutter, and when is it information?\nThe Ottomans eventually caught the NILI spy ring due in part to a strange\nmishap. In addition to shutters, NILI used carrier pigeons to convey coded\nmessages. On September 3, 1917, one of the pigeons diverted off course\nand landed in\u2014of all places\u2014the house of an Ottoman officer. The officer\nfound the coded message but couldn\u2019t decipher it. Nevertheless, the pigeon\nitself was crucial information. Its existence indicated to the Ottomans that a\nspy ring was operating under their noses. As Marshall McLuhan might have\nput it, the pigeon was the message. NILI agents learned about the capture of\nthe pigeon and immediately killed and buried all the remaining birds they\nhad, because the mere possession of carrier pigeons was now incriminating\ninformation. But the massacre of the pigeons did not save NILI. Within a\nmonth the spy network was uncovered, several of its members were\nexecuted, and Sarah Aaronsohn committed suicide to avoid divulging\nNILI\u2019s secrets under torture.5 When is a pigeon just a pigeon, and when is it\ninformation?\nClearly, then, information cannot be defined as specific types of material\nobjects. Any object\u2014a star, a shutter, a pigeon\u2014can be information in the\nright context. So exactly what context defines such objects as\n\u201cinformation\u201d? The naive view of information argues that objects are\ndefined as information in the context of truth seeking. Something is\ninformation if people use it to try to discover the truth. This view links the\nconcept of information with the concept of truth and assumes that the main\nrole of information is to represent reality. There is a reality \u201cout there,\u201d and\ninformation is something that represents that reality and that we can\ntherefore use to learn about reality. For example, the information NILI\nprovided the British was meant to represent the reality of Ottoman troop\nmovements. If the Ottomans massed ten thousand soldiers in Gaza\u2014the"}

If, on the other hand, there were actually twenty\nthousand Ottoman troops in Gaza, that piece of paper did not represent\nreality accurately, and could lead the British to make a disastrous military\nmistake.\nPut another way, the naive view argues that information is an attempt to\nrepresent reality, and when this attempt succeeds, we call it truth. While this\nbook takes many issues with the naive view, it agrees that truth is an\naccurate representation of reality. But this book also holds that most\ninformation is not an attempt to represent reality and that what defines\ninformation is something entirely different. Most information in human\nsociety, and indeed in other biological and physical systems, does not\nrepresent anything.\nI want to spend a little longer on this complex and crucial argument,\nbecause it constitutes the theoretical basis of the book.\nWHAT IS TRUTH?\nThroughout this book, \u201ctruth\u201d is understood as something that accurately\nrepresents certain aspects of reality. Underlying the notion of truth is the\npremise that there exists one universal reality. Anything that has ever\nexisted or will ever exist in the universe\u2014from the North Star, to the NILI\npigeon, to web pages on astrology\u2014is part of this single reality. This is why\nthe search for truth is a universal project. While different people, nations, or\ncultures may have competing beliefs and feelings, they cannot possess\ncontradictory truths, because they all share a universal reality. Anyone who\nrejects universalism rejects truth.\nTruth and reality are nevertheless different things, because no matter how\ntruthful an account is, it can never represent reality in all its aspects. If a\nNILI agent wrote that there are ten thousand Ottoman soldiers in Gaza, and"}
{"page": 40, "content": "there were indeed ten thousand soldiers there, this accurately pointed to a\ncertain aspect of reality, but it neglected many other aspects. The very act of\ncounting entities\u2014whether apples, oranges, or soldiers\u2014necessarily\nfocuses attention on the similarities between these entities while\ndiscounting differences.6 For example, saying only that there were ten\nthousand Ottoman soldiers in Gaza neglected to specify whether some were\nexperienced veterans and others were green recruits. If there were a\nthousand recruits and nine thousand old hands, the military reality was quite\ndifferent from if there were nine thousand rookies and a thousand battle-\nhardened veterans.\nThere were many other differences between the soldiers. Some were\nhealthy; others were sick. Some Ottoman troops were ethnically Turkish,\nwhile others were Arabs, Kurds, or Jews. Some were brave, others\ncowardly. Indeed, each soldier was a unique human being, with different\nparents and friends and individual fears and hopes. World War I poets like\nWilfred Owen famously attempted to represent these latter aspects of\nmilitary reality, which mere statistics never conveyed accurately. Does this\nimply that writing \u201cten thousand soldiers\u201d is always a misrepresentation of\nreality, and that to describe the military situation around Gaza in 1917, we\nmust specify the unique history and personality of every soldier?\nAnother problem with any attempt to represent reality is that reality\ncontains many viewpoints. For example, present-day Israelis, Palestinians,\nTurks, and Britons have different perspectives on the British invasion of the\nOttoman Empire, the NILI underground, and the activities of Sarah\nAaronsohn. That does not mean, of course, that there are several entirely\nseparate realities, or that there are no historical facts. There is just one\nreality, but it is complex.\nReality includes an objective level with objective facts that don\u2019t depend\non people\u2019s beliefs; for example, it is an objective fact that Sarah Aaronsohn\ndied on October 9, 1917, from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

{"page": 41, "content": "Reality also includes a subjective level with subjective facts like the\nbeliefs and feelings of various people, but in this case too facts can be\nseparated from errors. For example, it is a fact that Israelis tend to regard\nAaronsohn as a patriotic hero.

On November 2, 1917, the British foreign secretary,\nArthur Balfour, issued the Balfour Declaration, announcing that the British\ngovernment \u201cview with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national\nhome for the Jewish people.\u201d Israelis credit this in part to NILI and Sarah\nAaronsohn, whom they admire for her sacrifice. It is another fact that\nPalestinians evaluate things very differently. Rather than admiring\nAaronsohn, they regard her\u2014if they\u2019ve heard about her at all\u2014as an\nimperialist agent. Even though we are dealing here with subjective views\nand feelings, we can still distinguish truth from falsehood.

Ultimately, each individual has a\ndifferent perspective on the world, shaped by the intersection of different\npersonalities and life histories. Does this imply that when we wish to\ndescribe reality, we must always list all the different viewpoints it contains\nand that a truthful biography of Sarah Aaronsohn, for example, must specify\nhow every single Israeli and Palestinian has felt about her?\nTaken to extremes, such a pursuit of accuracy may lead us to try to\nrepresent the world on a one-to-one scale, as in the famous Jorge Luis"}

No\naccount of reality is 100 percent accurate, but some accounts are\nnevertheless more truthful than others.\nWHAT INFORMATION DOES\nAs noted above, the naive view sees information as an attempt to represent\nreality. It is aware that some information doesn\u2019t represent reality well, but\nit dismisses this as unfortunate cases of \u201cmisinformation\u201d or\n\u201cdisinformation.\u201d Misinformation is an honest mistake, occurring when\nsomeone tries to represent reality but gets it wrong. Disinformation is a\ndeliberate lie, occurring when someone consciously intends to distort our\nview of reality.\nThe naive view further believes that the solution to the problems caused\nby misinformation and disinformation is more information. This idea,\nsometimes called the counterspeech doctrine, is associated with the U.S.\nSupreme Court justice Louis D. Brandeis, who wrote in Whitney v."}
{"page": 43, "content": "California (1927) that the remedy to false speech is more speech and that in\nthe long term free discussion is bound to expose falsehoods and fallacies. If\nall information is an attempt to represent reality, then as the amount of\ninformation in the world grows, we can expect the flood of information to\nexpose the occasional lies and errors and to ultimately provide us with a\nmore truthful understanding of the world.\nOn this crucial point, this book strongly disagrees with the naive view.\nThere certainly are instances of information that attempt to represent reality\nand succeed in doing so, but this is not the defining characteristic of\ninformation. A few pages ago I referred to stars as information and casually\nmentioned astrologers alongside astronomers. Adherents of the naive view\nof information probably squirmed in their chairs when they read it.\nAccording to the naive view, astronomers derive \u201creal information\u201d from\nthe stars, while the information that astrologers imagine to read in\nconstellations is either \u201cmisinformation\u201d or \u201cdisinformation.\u201d If only people\nwere given more information about the universe, surely they would\nabandon astrology altogether. But the fact is that for thousands of years\nastrology has had a huge impact on history, and today millions of people\nstill check their star signs before making the most important decisions of\ntheir lives, like what to study and whom to marry. As of 2021, the global\nastrology market was valued at $12.8 billion.8\nNo matter what we think about the accuracy of astrological information,\nwe should acknowledge its important role in history. It has connected\nlovers, and even entire empires. Roman emperors routinely consulted\nastrologers before making decisions. Indeed, astrology was held in such\nhigh esteem that casting the horoscope of a reigning emperor was a capital\noffense. Presumably, anyone casting such a horoscope could foretell when\nand how the emperor would die.9 Rulers in some countries still take\nastrology very seriously. In 2005 the junta of Myanmar allegedly moved the\ncountry\u2019s capital from Yangon to Naypyidaw based on astrological advice.10\nA theory of information that cannot account for the historical significance"}
{"page": 44, "content": "of astrology is clearly inadequate.\nWhat the example of astrology illustrates is that errors, lies, fantasies, and\nfictions are information, too. Contrary to what the naive view of\ninformation says, information has no essential link to truth, and its role in\nhistory isn\u2019t to represent a preexisting reality. Rather, what information does\nis to create new realities by tying together disparate things\u2014whether\ncouples or empires. Its defining feature is connection rather than\nrepresentation, and information is whatever connects different points into a\nnetwork. Information doesn\u2019t necessarily inform us about things. Rather, it\nputs things in formation. Horoscopes put lovers in astrological formations,\npropaganda broadcasts put voters in political formations, and marching\nsongs put soldiers in military formations.\nAs a paradigmatic case, consider music. Most symphonies, melodies, and\ntunes don\u2019t represent anything, which is why it makes no sense to ask\nwhether they are true or false. Over the years people have created a lot of\nbad music, but not fake music. Without representing anything, music\nnevertheless does a remarkable job in connecting large numbers of people\nand synchronizing their emotions and movements. Music can make soldiers\nmarch in formation, clubbers sway together, church congregations clap in\nrhythm, and sports fans chant in unison.11\nThe role of information in connecting things is of course not unique to\nhuman history. A case can be made that this is the chief role of information\nin biology too.12 Consider DNA, the molecular information that makes\norganic life possible. Like music, DNA doesn\u2019t represent reality. Though\ngenerations of zebras have been fleeing lions, you cannot find in the zebra\nDNA a string of nucleobases representing \u201clion\u201d nor another string\nrepresenting \u201cflight.\u201d Similarly, zebra DNA contains no representation of\nthe sun, wind, rain, or any other external phenomena that zebras encounter\nduring their lives. Nor does DNA represent internal phenomena like body\norgans or emotions. There is no combination of nucleobases that represents\na heart, or fear."}
{"page": 45, "content": "Instead of trying to represent preexisting things, DNA helps to produce\nentirely new things. For instance, various strings of DNA nucleobases\ninitiate cellular chemical processes that result in the production of\nadrenaline. Adrenaline too doesn\u2019t represent reality in any way. Rather,\nadrenaline circulates through the body, initiating additional chemical\nprocesses that increase the heart rate and direct more blood to the muscles.13\nDNA and adrenaline thereby help to connect cells in the heart, cells in the\nleg muscles, and trillions of other cells throughout the body to form a\nfunctioning network that can do remarkable things, like run away from a\nlion.\nIf DNA represented reality, we could have asked questions like \u201cDoes\nzebra DNA represent reality more accurately than lion DNA?\u201d or \u201cIs the\nDNA of one zebra telling the truth about the world, while another zebra is\nmisled by her fake DNA?\u201d These, of course, are nonsensical questions. We\nmight evaluate DNA by the fitness of the organism it produces, but not by\ntruthfulness. While it is common to talk about DNA \u201cerrors,\u201d this refers\nonly to mutations in the process of copying DNA\u2014not to a failure to\nrepresent reality accurately. A genetic mutation that inhibits the production\nof adrenaline reduces the fitness of a particular zebra, ultimately causing the\nnetwork of cells to disintegrate, as when the zebra is killed by a lion and its\ntrillions of cells lose connection with one another and decompose. But this\nkind of network failure means disintegration, not disinformation. That\u2019s true\nof countries, political parties, and news networks as much as of zebras.\nCrucially, errors in the copying of DNA don\u2019t always reduce fitness. Once\nin a blue moon, they increase fitness. Without such mutations, there would\nbe no process of evolution. All life-forms exist thanks to genetic \u201cerrors.\u201d\nThe wonders of evolution are possible because DNA doesn\u2019t represent any\npreexisting realities; it creates new realities.\nLet us pause to digest the implications of this. Information is something\nthat creates new realities by connecting different points into a network. This\nstill includes the view of information as representation. Sometimes, a"}

The\nemphasis on connection leaves ample room for other types of information\nthat do not represent reality well. Sometimes erroneous representations of\nreality might also serve as a social nexus, as when millions of followers of a\nconspiracy theory watch a YouTube video claiming that the moon landing\nnever happened. These images convey an erroneous representation of\nreality, but they might nevertheless give rise to feelings of anger against the\nestablishment or pride in one\u2019s own wisdom that help create a cohesive new\ngroup.\nSometimes networks can be connected without any attempt to represent\nreality, neither accurate nor erroneous, as when genetic information\nconnects trillions of cells or when a stirring musical piece connects\nthousands of humans.\nAs a final example, consider Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of the Metaverse.\nThe Metaverse is a virtual universe made entirely of information. Unlike\nthe one-to-one map built by Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s imaginary empire, the\nMetaverse isn\u2019t an attempt to represent our world, but rather an attempt to\naugment or even replace our world.

Perhaps only in some remote deserts, tattered fragments of the\nold reality could still be found, sheltering an occasional beast or beggar.\nINFORMATION IN HUMAN HISTORY\nViewing information as a social nexus helps us understand many aspects of\nhuman history that confound the naive view of information as\nrepresentation. It explains the historical success not only of astrology but of\nmuch more important things, like the Bible. While some may dismiss\nastrology as a quaint sideshow in human history, nobody can deny the\ncentral role the Bible has played. If the main job of information had been to\nrepresent reality accurately, it would have been hard to explain why the\nBible became one of the most influential texts in history.\nThe Bible makes many serious errors in its description of both human\naffairs and natural processes. The book of Genesis claims that all human\ngroups\u2014including, for example, the San people of the Kalahari Desert and\nthe Aborigines of Australia\u2014descend from a single family that lived in the\nMiddle East about four thousand years ago.15 According to Genesis, after\nthe Flood all Noah\u2019s descendants lived together in Mesopotamia, but\nfollowing the destruction of the Tower of Babel they spread to the four\ncorners of the earth and became the ancestors of all living humans. In fact,\nthe ancestors of the San people lived in Africa for hundreds of thousands of\nyears without ever leaving the continent, and the ancestors of the\nAborigines settled Australia more than fifty thousand years ago.16 Both\ngenetic and archaeological evidence rule out the idea that the entire ancient\npopulations of South Africa and Australia were annihilated about four\nthousand years ago by a flood and that these areas were subsequently\nrepopulated by Middle Eastern immigrants.\nAn even graver distortion involves our understanding of infectious\ndiseases. The Bible routinely depicts epidemics as divine punishment for\nhuman sins17 and claims they can be stopped or prevented by prayers and"}
{"page": 48, "content": "religious rituals.18 However, epidemics are of course caused by pathogens\nand can be stopped or prevented by following hygiene rules and using\nmedicines and vaccines. This is today widely accepted even by religious\nleaders like the pope, who during the COVID-19 pandemic advised people\nto self-isolate, instead of congregating to pray together.19\nYet while the Bible has done a poor job in representing the reality of\nhuman origins, migrations, and epidemics, it has nevertheless been very\neffective in connecting billions of people and creating the Jewish and\nChristian religions. Like DNA initiating chemical processes that bind\nbillions of cells into organic networks, the Bible initiated social processes\nthat bonded billions of people into religious networks. And just as a\nnetwork of cells can do things that single cells cannot, so a religious\nnetwork can do things that individual humans cannot, like building temples,\nmaintaining legal systems, celebrating holidays, and waging holy wars.\nTo conclude, information sometimes represents reality, and sometimes\ndoesn\u2019t. But it always connects. This is its fundamental characteristic.\nTherefore, when examining the role of information in history, although it\nsometimes makes sense to ask \u201cHow well does it represent reality? Is it true\nor false?\u201d often the more crucial questions are \u201cHow well does it connect\npeople? What new network does it create?\u201d\nIt should be emphasized that rejecting the naive view of information as\nrepresentation does not force us to reject the notion of truth, nor does it\nforce us to embrace the populist view of information as a weapon. While\ninformation always connects, some types of information\u2014from scientific\nbooks to political speeches\u2014may strive to connect people by accurately\nrepresenting certain aspects of reality. But this requires a special effort,\nwhich most information does not make. This is why the naive view is\nwrong to believe that creating more powerful information technology will\nnecessarily result in a more truthful understanding of the world.

Rather, the secret of our\nsuccess is that we are talented at using information to connect lots of\nindividuals. Unfortunately, this ability often goes hand in hand with\nbelieving in lies, errors, and fantasies. This is why even technologically\nadvanced societies like Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union have been\nprone to hold delusional ideas, without their delusions necessarily\nweakening them.

{"page": 50, "content": "CHAPTER 2\nStories: Unlimited Connections\nW\ne Sapiens rule the world not because we are so wise but because we\nare the only animals that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. I\nhave explored this idea in my previous books Sapiens and Homo Deus, but\na brief recap is inescapable.\nThe Sapiens\u2019 ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has precursors\namong other animals. Some social mammals like chimpanzees display\nsignificant flexibility in the way they cooperate, while some social insects\nlike ants cooperate in very large numbers. But neither chimps nor ants\nestablish empires, religions, or trade networks. Sapiens are capable of doing\nsuch things because we are far more flexible than chimps and can\nsimultaneously cooperate in even larger numbers than ants. In fact, there is\nno upper limit to the number of Sapiens who can cooperate with one\nanother. The Catholic Church has about 1.4 billion members. China has a\npopulation of about 1.4 billion. The global trade network connects about 8\nbillion Sapiens.\nThis is surprising given that humans cannot form long-term intimate\nbonds with more than a few hundred individuals.1 It takes many years and\ncommon experiences to get to know someone\u2019s unique character and\nhistory and to cultivate ties of mutual trust and affection. Consequently, if\nSapiens networks were connected only by personal human-to-human bonds,\nour networks would have remained very small.

Each of their bands\nnumbered a few dozen individuals, and different bands rarely cooperated.3\nAbout seventy thousand years ago, Homo sapiens bands began displaying\nan unprecedented capacity to cooperate with one another, as evidenced by\nthe emergence of inter-band trade and artistic traditions and by the rapid\nspread of our species from our African homeland to the entire globe. What\nenabled different bands to cooperate is that evolutionary changes in brain\nstructure and linguistic abilities apparently gave Sapiens the aptitude to tell\nand believe fictional stories and to be deeply moved by them. Instead of\nbuilding a network from human-to-human chains alone\u2014as the\nNeanderthals, for example, did\u2014stories provided Homo sapiens with a new\ntype of chain: human-to-story chains. In order to cooperate, Sapiens no\nlonger had to know each other personally; they just had to know the same\nstory. And the same story can be familiar to billions of individuals. A story\ncan thereby serve like a central connector, with an unlimited number of\noutlets into which an unlimited number of people can plug. For example,\nthe 1.4 billion members of the Catholic Church are connected by the Bible\nand other key Christian stories; the 1.4 billion citizens of China are\nconnected by the stories of communist ideology and Chinese nationalism;\nand the 8 billion members of the global trade network are connected by\nstories about currencies, corporations, and brands.\nEven charismatic leaders who have millions of followers are an example\nof this rule rather than an exception. It may seem that in the case of ancient\nChinese emperors, medieval Catholic popes, or modern corporate titans it\nhas been a single flesh-and-blood human\u2014rather than a story\u2014that has\nserved as a nexus linking millions of followers. But, of course, in all these\ncases almost none of the followers has had a personal bond with the leader.\nInstead, what they have connected to has been a carefully crafted story\nabout the leader, and it is in this story that they have put their faith."}

Stalin is Soviet power. Stalin is what\nhe is in the newspapers and the portraits, not you, no\u2014not even me!\u201d4\nPresent-day influencers and celebrities would concur. Some have\nhundreds of millions of online followers, with whom they communicate\ndaily through social media. But there is very little authentic personal\nconnection there. The social media accounts are usually run by a team of\nexperts, and every image and word is professionally crafted and curated to\nmanufacture what is nowadays called a brand.5\nA \u201cbrand\u201d is a specific type of story. To brand a product means to tell a\nstory about that product, which may have little to do with the product\u2019s\nactual qualities but which consumers nevertheless learn to associate with\nthe product. For example, over the decades the Coca-Cola corporation has\ninvested tens of billions of dollars in advertisements that tell and retell the\nstory of the Coca-Cola drink.6 People have seen and heard the story so often\nthat many have come to associate a certain concoction of flavored water\nwith fun, happiness, and youth (as opposed to tooth decay, obesity, and\nplastic waste). That\u2019s branding.7\nAs Stalin knew, it is possible to brand not only products but also\nindividuals. A corrupt billionaire can be branded as the champion of the\npoor; a bungling imbecile can be branded as an infallible genius; and a guru\nwho sexually abuses his followers can be branded as a chaste saint. People\nthink they connect to the person, but in fact they connect to the story told\nabout the person, and there is often a huge gulf between the two.\nEven the story of Cher Ami, the heroic pigeon, was partly the product of a\nbranding campaign aimed at enhancing the public image of the U.S. Army\u2019s\nPigeon Service. A 2021 revisionist study by the historian Frank Blazich\nfound that though there is no doubt Cher Ami sustained severe injuries"}
{"page": 53, "content": "while transporting a message somewhere in Northern France, several key\nfeatures of the story are doubtful or inaccurate. First, relying on\ncontemporary military records, Blazich demonstrated that headquarters\nlearned about the exact location of the Lost Battalion about twenty minutes\nprior to the pigeon\u2019s arrival. It was not the pigeon that put a stop to the\nbarrage of friendly fire decimating the Lost Battalion. Even more crucially,\nthere is simply no proof that the pigeon carrying Major Whittlesey\u2019s\nmessage was Cher Ami. It might well have been another bird, while Cher\nAmi might have sustained his wounds a couple of weeks later, during an\naltogether different battle.\nAccording to Blazich, the doubts and inconsistencies in Cher Ami\u2019s story\nwere overshadowed by its propaganda value to the army and its appeal to\nthe public. Over the years the story was retold so many times that facts\nbecame hopelessly enmeshed with fiction. Journalists, poets, and\nfilmmakers added fanciful details to it, for example that the pigeon lost an\neye as well as a leg and that it was awarded the Distinguished Service\nCross. In the 1920s and 1930s Cher Ami became the most famous bird in\nthe world. When he died, his carefully preserved corpse was placed on\ndisplay at the Smithsonian Museum, where it became a pilgrimage site for\nAmerican patriots and World War I veterans. As the story grew in the\ntelling, it took over even the recollections of survivors of the Lost Battalion,\nwho came to accept the popular narrative at face value. Blazich recounts the\ncase of Sherman Eager, an officer in the Lost Battalion, who decades after\nthe war brought his children to see Cher Ami at the Smithsonian and told\nthem, \u201cYou all owe your lives to that pigeon.\u201d Whatever the facts may be,\nthe story of the self-sacrificing winged saviour proved irresistible.8\nAs a much more extreme example, consider Jesus. Two millennia of\nstorytelling have encased Jesus within such a thick cocoon of stories that it\nis impossible to recover the historical person.

While most Christians were not physically\npresent at the Last Supper, they have heard the story so many times, and\nthey have seen so many images of the event, that they \u201cremember\u201d it more\nvividly than they remember most of the family dinners in which they\nactually participated.\nInterestingly, Jesus\u2019s last supper was the Jewish Passover meal, which\naccording to the Gospel accounts Jesus shared with his disciples just before\nhis crucifixion. In Jewish tradition, the whole purpose of the Passover meal\nis to create and reenact artificial memories. Every year Jewish families sit\ntogether on the eve of Passover to eat and reminisce about \u201ctheir\u201d exodus\nfrom Egypt.

By\nNovember 2021, a single bitcoin was valued at more than $69,000, so the\nbitcoins Hanyecz paid for his two pizzas were worth $690 million, enough\nto purchase millions of pizzas.14 While the calorific value of pizza is an\nobjective reality that remained the same between 2010 and 2021, the\nfinancial value of bitcoin is an intersubjective reality that changed\ndramatically during the same period, depending on the stories people told\nand believed about bitcoin.\nAnother example. Suppose I ask, \u201cDoes the Loch Ness Monster exist?\u201d\nThis is a question about the objective level of reality. Some people believe\nthat dinosaur-like animals really do inhabit Loch Ness. Others dismiss the\nidea as a fantasy or a hoax. Over the years, many attempts have been made\nto resolve the disagreement once and for all, using scientific methods such"}

Based on the\navailable evidence, the scientific consensus is that the Loch Ness Monster\ndoes not exist. (A DNA survey conducted in 2019 found genetic material\nfrom three thousand species, but no monster. At most, Loch Ness may\ncontain some five-kilo eels.15) Many people may nevertheless continue to\nbelieve that the Loch Ness Monster exists, but believing it doesn\u2019t change\nobjective reality.\nIn contrast to animals, whose existence can be verified or disproved\nthrough objective tests, states are intersubjective entities. We normally don\u2019t\nnotice it, because everybody takes the existence of the United States, China,\nRussia, or Brazil for granted. But there are cases when people disagree\nabout the existence of certain states, and then their intersubjective status\nemerges. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for example, revolves around this\nmatter, because some people and governments refuse to acknowledge the\nexistence of Israel and others refuse to acknowledge the existence of\nPalestine. As of 2024, the governments of Brazil and China, for example,\nsay that both Israel and Palestine exist; the governments of the United\nStates and Cameroon recognize only Israel\u2019s existence; whereas the\ngovernments of Algeria and Iran recognize only Palestine. Other cases\nrange from Kosovo, which as of 2024 is recognized as a state by around\nhalf of the 193 UN members,16 to Abkhazia, which almost all governments\nsee as a sovereign territory of Georgia, but which is recognized as a state by\nRussia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria.17\nIndeed, almost all states pass at least temporarily through a phase during\nwhich their existence is contested, when struggling for independence. Did\nthe United States come into existence on July 4, 1776, or only when other\nstates like France and finally the U.K. recognized it? Between the\ndeclaration of U.S. independence on July 4, 1776, and the signing of the\nTreaty of Paris on September 3, 1783, some people like George Washington\nbelieved the United States existed, while other people like King George III"}

Unlike animals, states\nare not an objective reality. When we ask whether a particular state exists,\nwe are raising a question about intersubjective reality. If enough people\nagree that a particular state exists, then it does. It can then do things like\nsign legally binding treaties with other governments as well as NGOs and\nprivate corporations.\nOf all genres of stories, those that create intersubjective realities have been\nthe most crucial for the development of large-scale human networks.\nImplanting fake family memories is certainly helpful, but no religions or\nempires managed to survive for long without a strong belief in the existence\nof a god, a nation, a law code, or a currency. For the formation of the\nChristian Church, for example, it was important that people recollect what\nJesus said at the Last Supper, but the crucial step was making people\nbelieve that Jesus was a god rather than just an inspiring rabbi. For the\nformation of the Jewish religion, it was helpful that Jews \u201cremembered\u201d\nhow they together escaped slavery in Egypt, but the really decisive step was\nmaking all Jews adhere to the same religious law code, the Halakha.\nIntersubjective things like laws, gods, and currencies are extremely\npowerful within a particular information network and utterly meaningless\noutside it. Suppose a billionaire crashes his private jet on a deserted island\nand finds himself alone with a suitcase full of banknotes and bonds. When\nhe was in S\u00e3o Paulo or Mumbai, he could use these papers to make people\nfeed him, clothe him, protect him, and build him a private jet. But once he\nis cut off from other members of our information network, his banknotes\nand bonds immediately become worthless. He cannot use them to get the\nisland\u2019s monkeys to provide him with food or to build him a raft."}
{"page": 60, "content": "THE POWER OF STORIES\nWhether through implanting fake memories, forming fictional relationships,\nor creating intersubjective realities, stories produced large-scale human\nnetworks. These networks in turn completely changed the balance of power\nin the world. Story-based networks made Homo sapiens the most powerful\nof all animals, giving it a crucial edge not only over lions and mammoths\nbut also over other ancient human species like Neanderthals.\nNeanderthals lived in small isolated bands, and to the best of our\nknowledge different bands cooperated with one another only rarely and\nweakly, if at all.18 Stone Age Sapiens too lived in small bands of a few\ndozen individuals. But following the emergence of storytelling, Sapiens\nbands no longer lived in isolation. Bands were connected by stories about\nthings like revered ancestors, totem animals, and guardian spirits. Bands\nthat shared stories and intersubjective realities constituted a tribe. Each tribe\nwas a network connecting hundreds or even thousands of individuals.19\nBelonging to a large tribe had an obvious advantage in times of conflict.\nFive hundred Sapiens could easily defeat fifty Neanderthals.20 But tribal\nnetworks had many additional advantages. If we live in an isolated band of\nfifty people and a severe drought hits our home territory, many of us might\nstarve to death. If we try to migrate elsewhere, we are likely to encounter\nhostile groups, and we might also find it difficult to forage for food, water,\nand flint (to make tools) in unfamiliar territory. However, if our band is part\nof a tribal network, in times of need at least some of us could go live with\nour distant friends. If our shared tribal identity is strong enough, they would\nwelcome us and teach us about the local dangers and opportunities. A\ndecade or two later, we might reciprocate. The tribal network, then, acted\nlike an insurance policy. It minimized risk by spreading it across a lot more\npeople.21\nEven in quiet times Sapiens could benefit enormously from exchanging\ninformation not just with a few dozen members of a small band but with an"}
{"page": 61, "content": "entire tribal network. If one of the tribe\u2019s bands discovered a better way to\nmake spear points, learned how to heal wounds with some rare medicinal\nherb, or invented a needle to sew clothes, that knowledge could be quickly\npassed to the other bands. Even though individually Sapiens might not have\nbeen more intelligent than Neanderthals, five hundred Sapiens together\nwere far more intelligent than fifty Neanderthals.22\nAll this was made possible by stories. The power of stories is often missed\nor denied by materialist interpretations of history. In particular, Marxists\ntend to view stories as merely a smoke screen for underlying power\nrelations and material interests. According to Marxist theories, people are\nalways motivated by objective material interests and use stories only to\ncamouflage these interests and confound their rivals. For example, in this\nreading the Crusades, World War I, and the Iraq War were all fought for the\neconomic interests of powerful elites rather than for religious, nationalist, or\nliberal ideals. Understanding these wars means setting aside all the\nmythological fig leaves\u2014about God, patriotism, or democracy\u2014and\nobserving power relations in their nakedness.\nThis Marxist view, however, is not only cynical but wrong. While\nmaterialist interests certainly played a role in the Crusades, World War I, the\nIraq War, and most other human conflicts, that does not mean that religious,\nnational, and liberal ideals played no role at all. Moreover, materialist\ninterests by themselves cannot explain the identities of the rival camps.\nWhy is it that in the twelfth century landowners and merchants from\nFrance, Germany, and Italy united to conquer territories and trade routes in\nthe Levant\u2014instead of landowners and merchants from France and North\nAfrica uniting to conquer Italy? And why is it that in 2003, the United\nStates and Britain sought to conquer the oil fields of Iraq, rather than the\ngas fields of Norway? Can this really be explained by purely materialist\nconsiderations, without any recourse to people\u2019s religious and ideological\nbeliefs?\nIn fact, all relations between large-scale human groups are shaped by"}
{"page": 62, "content": "stories, because the identities of these groups are themselves defined by\nstories. There are no objective definitions for who is British, American,\nNorwegian, or Iraqi; all these identities are shaped by national and religious\nmyths that are constantly challenged and revised. Marxists may claim that\nlarge-scale groups have objective identities and interests, independent of\nstories. If that is so, how can we explain that only humans have large-scale\ngroups like tribes, nations, and religions, whereas chimpanzees lack them?\nAfter all, chimpanzees share with humans all our objective material\ninterests; they too need to drink, eat, and protect themselves from diseases.\nThey too want sex and social power. But chimpanzees cannot maintain\nlarge-scale groups, because they are unable to create the stories that connect\nsuch groups and define their identities and interests. Contrary to Marxist\nthinking, large-scale identities and interests in history are always\nintersubjective; they are never objective.\nThis is good news. If history had been shaped solely by material interests\nand power struggles, there would be no point talking to people who\ndisagree with us. Any conflict would ultimately be the result of objective\npower relations, which cannot be changed merely by talking. In particular,\nif privileged people can see and believe only those things that enshrine their\nprivileges, how can anything except violence persuade them to renounce\nthose privileges and alter their beliefs? Luckily, since history is shaped by\nintersubjective stories, sometimes we can avert conflict and make peace by\ntalking with people, changing the stories in which they and we believe, or\ncoming up with a new story that everyone can accept.\nTake, for example, the rise of Nazism. There certainly were material\ninterests that drove millions of Germans to support Hitler. The Nazis would\nprobably never have come to power if it wasn\u2019t for the economic crisis of\nthe early 1930s. However, it is wrong to think that the Third Reich was the\ninevitable outcome of underlying power relations and material interests.\nHitler won the 1933 elections because during the economic crisis millions\nof Germans came to believe the Nazi story rather than one of the alternative"}

We\ncan confidently say that it was a mistake, and that Germans could have\nchosen better stories, because we know what happened next. Twelve years\nof Nazi rule didn\u2019t foster the Germans\u2019 material interests. Nazism led to the\ndestruction of Germany and the deaths of millions. Later, when Germans\nadopted liberal democracy, this did lead to a lasting improvement in their\nlives. Couldn\u2019t the Germans have skipped the failed Nazi experiment and\nput their faith in liberal democracy already in the early 1930s? The position\nof this book is that they could have. History is often shaped not by\ndeterministic power relations, but rather by tragic mistakes that result from\nbelieving in mesmerizing but harmful stories.\nTHE NOBLE LIE\nThe centrality of stories reveals something fundamental about the power of\nour species, and it explains why power doesn\u2019t always go hand in hand with\nwisdom. The naive view of information says that information leads to truth,\nand knowing the truth helps people to gain both power and wisdom. This\nsounds reassuring. It implies that people who ignore the truth are unlikely to\nhave much power, whereas people who respect the truth can gain much\npower, but that power would be tempered by wisdom. For example, people\nwho ignore the truth about human biology might believe racist myths but\nwill not be able to produce powerful medicines and bioweapons, whereas\npeople who understand biology will have that kind of power but will not\nuse it in the service of racist ideologies. If this had indeed been the case, we\ncould sleep calmly, trusting our presidents, high priests, and CEOs to be\nwise and honest. A politician, a movement, or a country might conceivably\nget ahead here and there with the help of lies and deceptions, but in the long\nterm that would be a self-defeating strategy.\nUnfortunately, this is not the world in which we live. In history, power"}

To succeed, you obviously need some accurate\nknowledge of physics. But you also need lots of people to mine uranium\nore, build nuclear reactors, and provide food for the construction workers,\nminers, and physicists. The Manhattan Project directly employed about\n130,000 people, with millions more working to sustain them.23 Robert\nOppenheimer could devote himself to his equations because he relied on\nthousands of miners to extract uranium at the Eldorado mine in northern\nCanada and the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo24\u2014not to mention\nthe farmers who grew potatoes for his lunch. If you want to make an atom\nbomb, you must find a way to make millions of people cooperate.\nIt is the same with all ambitious projects that humans undertake. A Stone\nAge band going to hunt a mammoth obviously needed to know some true\nfacts about mammoths. If they believed they could kill a mammoth by\ncasting spells, their hunting expedition would have failed. But just knowing\nfacts about mammoths wasn\u2019t enough, either. The hunters also needed to\nmake sure all of them agreed on the same plan and bravely did their bit\neven in the face of mortal danger. If they believed that by pronouncing a\nspell they could guarantee a good afterlife for dead hunters, their hunting\nexpeditions had a much higher chance of success. Even if objectively the\nspell was powerless and did not benefit dead hunters in any way, by\nfortifying the courage and solidarity of living hunters, it nevertheless made\na crucial contribution to the hunt\u2019s success.25\nWhile power depends on both truth and order, in most cases it is the\npeople who know how to maintain order who call the shots, giving\ninstructions to the people who merely know the truth about things like\nmammoths or nuclear physics.

{"page": 65, "content": "experts in Shiite theology.\nWhat the people at the top know, which nuclear physicists don\u2019t always\nrealize, is that telling the truth about the universe is hardly the most efficient\nway to produce order among large numbers of humans. It is true that E =\nmc\u00b2, and it explains a lot of what happens in the universe, but knowing that\nE = mc\u00b2 usually doesn\u2019t resolve political disagreements or inspire people to\nmake sacrifices for a common cause. Instead, what holds human networks\ntogether tends to be fictional stories, especially stories about intersubjective\nthings like gods, money, and nations. When it comes to uniting people,\nfiction enjoys two inherent advantages over the truth. First, fiction can be\nmade as simple as we like, whereas the truth tends to be complicated,\nbecause the reality it is supposed to represent is complicated. Take, for\nexample, the truth about nations. It is difficult to grasp that the nation to\nwhich one belongs is an intersubjective entity that exists only in our\ncollective imagination. You rarely hear politicians say such things in their\npolitical speeches. It is far easier to believe that our nation is God\u2019s chosen\npeople, entrusted by the Creator with some special mission. This simple\nstory has been repeatedly told by countless politicians from Israel to Iran\nand from the United States to Russia.\nSecond, the truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it\nmore comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth. In contrast,\nfiction is highly malleable. The history of every nation contains some dark\nepisodes that citizens don\u2019t like to acknowledge and remember. An Israeli\npolitician who in her election speeches details the miseries inflicted on\nPalestinian civilians by the Israeli occupation is unlikely to get many votes.\nIn contrast, a politician who builds a national myth by ignoring\nuncomfortable facts, focusing on glorious moments in the Jewish past, and\nembellishing reality wherever necessary may well sweep to power.

Citizens should be told, Plato\nwrote, that they were all born out of the earth, that the land is their mother,\nand that they therefore owe filial loyalty to the motherland. They should\nfurther be told that when they were conceived, the gods intermingled\ndifferent metals\u2014gold, silver, bronze, and iron\u2014into them, which justifies\na natural hierarchy between golden rulers and bronze servants. While\nPlato\u2019s utopia was never realized in practice, numerous polities through the\nages told their inhabitants variations of this noble lie.\nPlato\u2019s noble lie notwithstanding, we should not conclude that all\npoliticians are liars or that all national histories are deceptions. The choice\nisn\u2019t simply between telling the truth and lying. There is a third option.\nTelling a fictional story is lying only when you pretend that the story is a\ntrue representation of reality. Telling a fictional story isn\u2019t lying when you\navoid such pretense and acknowledge that you are trying to create a new\nintersubjective reality rather than represent a preexisting objective reality.\nFor example, on September 17, 1787, the Constitutional Convention\nsigned the U.S. Constitution, which came into force in 1789. The\nConstitution didn\u2019t reveal any preexisting truth about the world, but\ncrucially it wasn\u2019t a lie, either. Rejecting Plato\u2019s recommendation, the\nauthors of the text didn\u2019t deceive anyone about the text\u2019s origins. They\ndidn\u2019t pretend that the text came down from heaven or that it had been\ninspired by some god. Rather, they acknowledged that it was an extremely\ncreative legal fiction generated by fallible human beings.\n\u201cWe the People of the United States,\u201d says the Constitution about its own\norigins, \u201cin Order to form a more perfect Union \u2026 do ordain and establish\nthis Constitution.\u201d Despite the acknowledgment that it is a human-made\nlegal fiction, the U.S. Constitution indeed managed to form a powerful"}

The U.S. Constitution has thus\nfunctioned like a tune that without claiming to represent anything has\nnevertheless made numerous people act together in order.\nIt is crucial to note that \u201corder\u201d should not be confused with fairness or\njustice. The order created and maintained by the U.S. Constitution\ncondoned slavery, the subordination of women, the expropriation of\nindigenous people, and extreme economic inequality. The genius of the U.S.\nConstitution is that by acknowledging that it is a legal fiction created by\nhuman beings, it was able to provide mechanisms to reach agreement on\namending itself and remedying its own injustices (as chapter 5 explores in\ngreater depth). The Constitution\u2019s Article V details how people can propose\nand ratify such amendments, which \u201cshall be valid to all Intents and\nPurposes, as Part of this Constitution.\u201d Less than a century after the\nConstitution was written, the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery.\nIn this, the U.S. Constitution was fundamentally different from stories that\ndenied their fictive nature and claimed divine origin, such as the Ten\nCommandments. Like the U.S. Constitution, the Ten Commandments\nendorsed slavery. The Tenth Commandment says, \u201cYou shall not covet your\nneighbor\u2019s house. You shall not covet your neighbor\u2019s wife, or his male\nslave or female slave\u201d (Exodus 20:17). This implies that God is perfectly\nokay with people holding slaves, and objects only to the coveting of slaves\nbelonging to someone else. But unlike the U.S. Constitution, the Ten\nCommandments failed to provide any amendment mechanism. There is no\nEleventh Commandment that says, \u201cYou can amend commandments by a\ntwo-thirds majority vote.\u201d\nThis crucial difference between the two texts is clear from their opening\ngambits. The U.S. Constitution opens with \u201cWe the People.\u201d By\nacknowledging its human origin, it invests humans with the power to\namend it. The Ten Commandments open with \u201cI am the Lord your God.\u201d"}

As a\nresult, the biblical text still endorses slavery even today.\nAll human political systems are based on fictions, but some admit it, and\nsome do not. Being truthful about the origins of our social order makes it\neasier to make changes in it. If humans like us invented it, we can amend it.\nBut such truthfulness comes at a price. Acknowledging the human origins\nof the social order makes it harder to persuade everyone to agree on it. If\nhumans like us invented it, why should we accept it? As we shall see in\nchapter 5, until the late eighteenth century the lack of mass communication\ntechnology made it extremely difficult to conduct open debates between\nmillions of people about the rules of the social order. To maintain order,\nRussian tsars, Muslim caliphs, and Chinese sons of heaven therefore\nclaimed that the fundamental rules of society came down from heaven and\nwere not open to human amendment. In the early twenty-first century, many\npolitical systems still claim superhuman authority and oppose open debates\nthat may result in unwelcome changes.\nTHE PERENNIAL DILEMMA\nAfter we understand the key role of fiction in history, it is finally possible to\npresent a more complete model of information networks, which goes\nbeyond both the naive view of information and the populist critique of that\nview. Contrary to the naive view, information isn\u2019t the raw material of truth,\nand human information networks aren\u2019t geared only to discover the truth.\nBut contrary to the populist view, information isn\u2019t just a weapon, either.\nRather, to survive and flourish, every human information network needs to\ndo two things simultaneously: discover truth and create order. Accordingly,\nas history unfolded, human information networks have been developing two\ndistinct sets of skills.

It is a difficult process to use information to discover the truth and\nsimultaneously use it to maintain order. What makes things worse is that\nthese two processes are often contradictory, because it is frequently easier to\nmaintain order through fictions. Sometimes\u2014as in the case of the U.S.\nConstitution\u2014fictional stories may acknowledge their fictionality, but more\noften they disavow it. Religions, for example, always claim to be an\nobjective and eternal truth rather than a fictional story invented by humans.\nIn such cases, the search for truth threatens the foundations of the social\norder. Many societies require their populations not to know their true\norigins: ignorance is strength. What happens, then, when people get\nuncomfortably close to the truth? What happens when the same bit of\ninformation reveals an important fact about the world, and also undermines\nthe noble lie that holds society together? In such cases society may seek to\npreserve order by placing limits on the search for truth.\nOne obvious example is Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Understanding"}
{"page": 70, "content": "evolution greatly advances our understanding of the origins and biology of\nspecies, including Homo sapiens, but it also undermines the central myths\nthat maintain order in numerous societies. No wonder that various\ngovernments and churches have banned or limited the teaching of\nevolution, preferring to sacrifice truth for the sake of order.26\nA related problem is that an information network may allow and even\nencourage people to search for truth, but only in specific fields that help\ngenerate power without threatening the social order. The result can be a\nvery powerful network that is singularly lacking in wisdom. Nazi Germany,\nfor example, cultivated many of the world\u2019s leading experts in chemistry,\noptics, engineering, and rocket science. It was largely Nazi rocket science\nthat later brought the Americans to the moon.27 This scientific prowess\nhelped the Nazis build an extremely powerful war machine, which was then\ndeployed in the service of a deranged and murderous mythology. Under\nNazi rule Germans were encouraged to develop rocket science, but they\nwere not free to question racist theories about biology and history.\nThat\u2019s a major reason why the history of human information networks\nisn\u2019t a triumphant march of progress. While over the generations human\nnetworks have grown increasingly powerful, they have not necessarily\ngrown increasingly wise. If a network privileges order over truth, it can\nbecome very powerful but use that power unwisely.\nInstead of a march of progress, the history of human information networks\nis a tightrope walk trying to balance truth with order.

Many nations have first been conceived in the imagination of poets.\nSarah Aaronsohn and the NILI underground are remembered by present-day\nIsraelis as some of the first Zionists who risked their lives in the 1910s to\nestablish a Jewish state in Palestine, but from where did NILI members get\nthis idea in the first place? They were inspired by an earlier generation of\npoets, thinkers, and visionaries such as Theodor Herzl and Hayim Nahman\nBialik.\nIn the 1890s and first decade of the twentieth century, Bialik, a Ukrainian\nJew, published numerous poems and stories bewailing the persecution and\nweakness of European Jews and calling on them to take their fate in their\nhands\u2014to defend themselves by force of arms, immigrate to Palestine, and\nthere establish their own state. One of his most stirring poems was written\nfollowing the Kishinev Pogrom of 1903, in which forty-nine Jews were\nmurdered and dozens more were injured.1 \u201cIn the City of Slaughter\u201d\ncondemned the murderous antisemitic mob who perpetrated the atrocities,\nbut it also criticized the Jews themselves for their pacifism and"}

The poem compares the Jewish men to terrified mice and\nimagines how they quietly prayed to God to perform some miracle, which\nfailed to materialize. The poem then tells how even after the pogrom was\nover, the survivors had no thought of arming themselves and instead entered\nTalmudic disputations about whether the raped women were now\nritualistically \u201cdefiled\u201d or whether they were still \u201cpure.\u201d This poem is\nmandatory reading in many Israeli schools today. It is also mandatory\nreading for anyone wishing to understand how after two millennia of being\none of the most pacifist groups in history, Jews built one of the most\nformidable armies in the world. Not for nothing was Bialik named Israel\u2019s\nnational poet.2\nThe fact that Bialik lived in Ukraine, and was intimately familiar with the\npersecution of Ashkenazi Jews in eastern Europe but had little\nunderstanding of conditions in Palestine, contributed to the subsequent\nconflict there between Jews and Arabs. Bialik\u2019s poems inspired Jews to see\nthemselves as victims in dire need of developing their military might and\nbuilding their own country, but hardly considered the catastrophic\nconsequences for the Arab inhabitants of Palestine, or indeed for the\nMizrahi Jewish communities native to the Middle East. When the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict exploded in the late 1940s, hundreds of thousands of\nPalestinians and hundreds of thousands of Mizrahi Jews were driven out of\ntheir ancestral homes in the Middle East, partly as a result of poems\ncomposed half a century earlier in Ukraine.3\nWhile Bialik was writing in Ukraine, the Hungarian Jew Theodor Herzl\nwas busy organizing the Zionist movement in the 1890s and early years of\nthe twentieth century.

The Old New Land\nappeared in Hebrew under the title Tel Aviv (a loose Hebrew translation of\n\u201cOld New Land\u201d). The city of Tel Aviv, established seven years after the\nbook\u2019s publication, took its name from the book. While Bialik is Israel\u2019s\nnational poet, Herzl is known as the visionary of the state.\nThe yarns Bialik and Herzl wove ignored many crucial facts about\ncontemporary reality, most notably that around 1900 the Jews of Palestine\ncomprised only 6\u20139 percent of the region\u2019s total population of about\n600,000 people.4 While disregarding such demographic facts, Bialik and\nHerzl accorded great importance to mythology, most notably the stories of\nthe Bible, without which modern Zionism is unimaginable. Bialik and Herzl\nwere also influenced by the nationalist myths that were created in the\nnineteenth century by almost every other ethnic group in Europe. The\nUkrainian Jew Bialik and the Hungarian Jew Herzl did for Zionism what\nwas earlier done by the poets Taras Shevchenko for Ukrainian nationalism,5\nS\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi for Hungarian nationalism,6 and Adam Mickiewicz for Polish\nnationalism.7 Observing the growth of other national movements all around,\nHerzl wrote that nations arise \u201cout of dreams, songs, fantasies.\u201d8\nBut dreams, songs, and fantasies, however inspiring, are not enough to\ncreate a functioning nation-state. Bialik inspired generations of Jewish\nfighters, but to equip and maintain an army, it is also necessary to raise\ntaxes and buy guns. Herzl\u2019s utopian book laid the foundations for the city of\nTel Aviv, but to keep the city going, it was also necessary to dig a sewage\nsystem. When all is said and done, the essence of patriotism isn\u2019t reciting\nstirring poems about the beauty of the motherland, and it certainly isn\u2019t\nmaking hate-filled speeches against foreigners and minorities.

This, however, is not the\nkind of information that can be turned into a memorable poem or a\ncaptivating myth. Instead, tax records come in the shape of various types of\nlists, ranging from a simple item-by-item record to more elaborate tables\nand spreadsheets. No matter how intricate these data sets may become, they\neschew narrative in favor of dryly listing amounts owed and amounts paid.\nPoets can afford to ignore such mundane facts, but tax collectors cannot.\nLists are crucial not only for national taxation systems but also for almost\nall other complex financial institutions. Corporations, banks, and stock\nmarkets cannot exist without them. A church, a university, or a library that\nwants to balance its budget soon realizes that in addition to priests and poets\nwho can mesmerize people with stories, it needs accountants who know\ntheir way around the various types of lists.\nLists and stories are complementary. National myths legitimize the tax\nrecords, while the tax records help transform aspirational stories into\nconcrete schools and hospitals. Something analogous happens in the field of\nfinance. The dollar, the pound sterling, and the bitcoin all come into being\nby persuading people to believe a story, and tales told by bankers, finance\nministers, and investment gurus raise or lower their value. When the\nchairperson of the Federal Reserve wants to curb inflation, when a finance\nminister wants to pass a new budget, and when a tech entrepreneur wants to\ndraw investors, they all turn to storytelling. But to actually manage a bank,\na budget, or a start-up, lists are essential.\nThe big problem with lists, and the crucial difference between lists and\nstories, is that lists tend to be far more boring than stories, which means that\nwhile we easily remember stories, we find it difficult to remember lists.\nThis is an important fact about how the human brain processes information."}

In 1987\u201388, a seventy-eight-episode version\n(running to about 2,730 hours) was the most watched television series in the\nworld, with more than 650 million viewers.

Mnemonic methods used to memorize lists of\nitems often work by weaving the items into a plot, thereby turning the list\ninto a story.12 But even with the help of such mnemonic devices, who could\nremember their country\u2019s tax records or budget? The information may be\nvital\u2014determining what quality of health care, education, and welfare\nservices citizens enjoy\u2014but our brains are not adapted to remembering\nsuch things. Unlike national poems and myths, which can be stored in our\nbrains, complex national taxation and administration systems have required\na unique nonorganic information technology in order to function. This\ntechnology is the written document.\nTO KILL A LOAN\nThe written document was invented many times in many places. Some of\nthe earliest examples come from ancient Mesopotamia. A cuneiform clay\ntablet dated to the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month of the forty-first\nyear of the reign of King Shulgi of Ur (ca. 2053/4 BCE) recorded the\nmonthly deliveries of sheep and goats. Fifteen sheep were delivered on the\nsecond day of the month, 7 sheep on the third day, 11 sheep on the fourth,\n219 on the fifth, 47 on the sixth, and so on until 3 sheep were delivered on\nthe twenty-eighth. In total, says the clay tablet, 896 animals were received\nthat month. Remembering all these deliveries was important for the royal\nadministration, to monitor people\u2019s obedience and to keep track of available\nresources. While doing so in one\u2019s head was a formidable challenge, it was\neasy for a learned scribe to write them down on a clay tablet.13\nLike stories and like all other information technologies in history, written\ndocuments didn\u2019t necessarily represent reality accurately. The Ur tablet, for\nexample, contained a mistake. The document says that a total of 896\nanimals were received during that month, but when modern scholars added\nup all the individual entries they reached a total of 898. The scribe who"}
{"page": 78, "content": "wrote the document apparently made a mistake when he calculated the\noverall tally, and the tablet preserved this mistake for posterity.\nBut whether true or false, written documents created new realities. By\nrecording lists of properties, taxes, and payments, they made it far easier to\ncreate administrative systems, kingdoms, religious organizations, and trade\nnetworks. More specifically, documents changed the method used for\ncreating intersubjective realities. In oral cultures, intersubjective realities\nwere created by telling a story that many people repeated with their mouths\nand remembered in their brains. Brain capacity consequently placed a limit\non the kinds of intersubjective realities that humans created. Humans\ncouldn\u2019t forge an intersubjective reality that their brains couldn\u2019t remember.\nThis limit could be transcended, however, by writing documents. The\ndocuments didn\u2019t represent an objective empirical reality; the reality was\nthe documents themselves. As we shall see in later chapters, written\ndocuments thereby provided precedents and models that would eventually\nbe used by computers. The ability of computers to create intersubjective\nrealities is an extension of the power of clay tablets and pieces of paper.\nAs a key example, consider ownership. In oral communities that lacked\nwritten documents, ownership was an intersubjective reality created through\nthe words and behaviors of the community members. To own a field meant\nthat your neighbors agreed that this field was yours and behaved\naccordingly. They didn\u2019t build a hut on that field, graze their livestock there,\nor pick fruits there without first asking your permission. Ownership was\ncreated and maintained by people continuously saying or signaling things to\none another. This made ownership the affair of a local community and\nplaced a limit on the ability of a distant central authority to control all\nlandownership. No king, minister, or priest could remember who owned\neach field in hundreds of distant villages. This also placed a limit on the\nability of individuals to claim and exercise absolute property rights, and\ninstead favored various forms of communal property rights. For example,\nyour neighbors might acknowledge your right to cultivate a field but not"}
{"page": 79, "content": "your right to sell it to foreigners.14\nIn a literate state, to own a field increasingly came to mean that it is\nwritten on some clay tablet, bamboo strip, piece of paper, or silicon chip\nthat you own that field. If your neighbors have been grazing their sheep for\nyears on a piece of land, and none of them ever said that you own it, but\nyou can somehow produce an official document that says it is yours, you\nhave a good chance of enforcing your claim. Conversely, if all the\nneighbors agree that it is your field but you don\u2019t have any official\ndocument that proves it, tough luck. Ownership is still an intersubjective\nreality created by exchanging information, but the information now takes\nthe form of a written document (or a computer file) rather than of people\ntalking and gesturing to each other. This means that ownership can now be\ndetermined by a central authority that produces and holds the relevant\ndocuments. It also means that you can sell your field without asking your\nneighbors\u2019 permission, simply by transferring the crucial document to\nsomeone else.\nThe power of documents to create intersubjective realities was beautifully\nmanifested in the Old Assyrian dialect, which treated documents as living\nthings that could also be killed. Loan contracts were \u201ckilled\u201d (du\u0101kum)\nwhen the debt was repaid. This was done by destroying the tablet, adding\nsome mark to it, or breaking its seal. The loan contract didn\u2019t represent\nreality; it was the reality. If somebody repaid the loan but failed to \u201ckill the\ndocument,\u201d the debt was still owed. Conversely, if somebody didn\u2019t repay\nthe loan but the document \u201cdied\u201d in some other way\u2014perhaps the dog ate it\n\u2014the debt was no more.15 The same happens with money. If your dog eats a\nhundred-dollar bill, those hundred dollars cease to exist.\nIn Shulgi\u2019s Ur, in ancient Assyria, and in numerous subsequent polities,\nsocial, economic, and political relations relied on documents that create\nreality instead of merely representing it. When writing constitutions, peace\ntreaties, and commercial contracts, lawyers, politicians, and businesspeople\nwrangle for weeks and even months over each word\u2014because they know"}

It solves\nsome old problems but creates new ones. In the early 1730s BCE,\nNar\u00e2mtani, a priestess in the Mesopotamian city of Sippar, wrote a letter\n(on a clay tablet) to a relative, asking him to send her a few clay tablets he\nkept in his house. She explained that her claim to an inheritance was being\ncontested and she couldn\u2019t prove her case in court without those documents.\nShe ended her message with a plea: \u201cNow, do not neglect me!\u201d16\nWe don\u2019t know what happened next, but just imagine the situation if the\nrelative searched his house but could not find the missing tablets. As people\nproduced more and more documents, finding them turned out to be far from\neasy. This was a particular challenge for kings, priests, merchants, and\nanyone else who accumulated thousands of documents in their archives.\nHow do you find the right tax record, payment receipt, or business contract\nwhen you need it? Written documents were much better than human brains\nin recording certain types of information. But they created a new and very\nthorny problem: retrieval.17\nThe brain is remarkably efficient in retrieving whatever information is\nstored in its network of tens of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses.\nThough our brain archives countless complex stories about our personal\nlife, our national history, and our religious mythology, healthy people can\nretrieve information about any of them in less than a second. What did you\neat for breakfast? Who was your first crush? When did your country gain its\nindependence? What\u2019s the first verse in the Bible?\nHow did you retrieve all these pieces of information?

{"page": 81, "content": "they are stored and retrieved.18 What we do know is that millions of years of\nevolution streamlined the brain\u2019s retrieval processes. However, once\nhumans have outsourced memories from organic brains to inorganic\ndocuments, retrieval could no longer rely on that streamlined biological\nsystem. Nor could it rely on the foraging abilities that humans evolved over\nmillions of years. Evolution has adapted humans for finding fruits and\nmushrooms in a forest, but not for finding documents in an archive.\nForagers locate fruits and mushrooms in a forest, because evolution has\norganized forests according to a discernible organic order. Fruit trees\nphotosynthesize, so they require sunlight. Mushrooms feed on dead organic\nmatter, which can usually be found in the ground. So mushrooms are\nusually down at soil level, whereas fruits grow further up. Another common\nrule is that apples grow on apple trees, whereas figs grow on figs trees. So if\nyou are looking for an apple, you first need to locate an apple tree, and then\nlook up. When living in a forest, humans learn this organic order.\nIt is very different with archives. Since documents aren\u2019t organisms, they\ndon\u2019t obey any biological laws, and evolution didn\u2019t organize them for us.\nTax reports don\u2019t grow on a tax-report shelf. They need to be placed there.\nFor that, somebody first needs to come up with the idea of categorizing\ninformation by shelves, and to decide which documents should go on which\nshelf.

That order is\ncalled bureaucracy.\nBureaucracy is the way people in large organizations solved the retrieval\nproblem and thereby created bigger and more powerful information\nnetworks. But like mythology, bureaucracy too tends to sacrifice truth for\norder. By inventing a new order and imposing it on the world, bureaucracy\ndistorted people\u2019s understanding of the world in unique ways.

Bureaucracy seeks to solve the retrieval problem by dividing\nthe world into drawers, and knowing which document goes into which\ndrawer.\nThe principle remains the same regardless of whether the document is\nplaced into a drawer, a shelf, a basket, a jar, a computer folder, or any other\nreceptacle: divide and rule. Divide the world into containers, and keep the\ncontainers separate so the documents don\u2019t get mixed up. This principle,\nhowever, comes with a price. Instead of focusing on understanding the\nworld as it is, bureaucracy is often busy imposing a new and artificial order\non the world. Bureaucrats begin by inventing various drawers, which are\nintersubjective realities that don\u2019t necessarily correspond to any objective\ndivisions in the world. The bureaucrats then try to force the world to fit into\nthese drawers, and if the fit isn\u2019t very good, the bureaucrats push harder.\nAnyone who ever filled out an official form knows this only too well. When\nyou fill out the form, and none of the listed options fits your circumstances,\nyou must adapt yourself to the form, rather than the form adapting to you.\nReducing the messiness of reality to a limited number of fixed drawers\nhelps bureaucrats keep order, but it comes at the expense of truth. Because\nthey are fixated on their drawers\u2014even when reality is far more complex\u2014\nbureaucrats often develop a distorted understanding of the world.\nThe urge to divide reality into rigid drawers also leads bureaucrats to\npursue narrow goals irrespective of the wider impact of their actions.

If the government then establishes a new department to\ncombat pollution, its bureaucrats are likely to push for ever more stringent\nregulations, even if this results in economic ruin for communities upstream.\nIdeally, someone should be able to take into account all the different\nconsiderations and aspects, but such a holistic approach requires\ntranscending or abolishing the bureaucratic division.\nThe distortions created by bureaucracy affect not only government\nagencies and private corporations but also scientific disciplines. Consider,\nfor example, how universities are divided into different faculties and\ndepartments. History is separate from biology and from mathematics. Why?\nCertainly this division doesn\u2019t reflect objective reality. It is the\nintersubjective invention of academic bureaucrats. The COVID-19\npandemic, for example, was at one and the same time a historical,\nbiological, and mathematical event. But the academic study of pandemics is\ndivided between the separate departments of history, biology, and\nmathematics (among others). Students pursuing an academic degree must\nusually decide to which of these departments they belong. Their decision\nlimits their choice of courses, which in turn shapes their understanding of\nthe world. Mathematics students learn how to predict future morbidity\nlevels from present rates of infection; biology students learn how viruses\nmutate over time; and history students learn how religious and political\nbeliefs affect people\u2019s willingness to follow government instructions. To\nfully understand COVID-19 requires taking into account mathematical,\nbiological, and historical phenomena, but academic bureaucracy doesn\u2019t\nencourage such a holistic approach.\nAs you climb the academic ladder, the pressure to specialize only\nincreases. The academic world is ruled by the law of publish or perish. If\nyou want a job, you must publish in peer-reviewed journals. But journals\nare divided by discipline, and publishing an article on virus mutations in a"}

Biologists should have a deep\nunderstanding of evolution and know how to read and interpret DNA\nmolecules. Things that fall in between categories\u2014like the interplay\nbetween human political ideologies and virus evolution\u2014are often left\nunaddressed.20\nTo appreciate how academics force a messy and fluid world into rigid\nbureaucratic categories, let\u2019s dig a little deeper in the specific discipline of\nbiology. Before Darwin could explain the origin of species, earlier scholars\nlike Carl Linnaeus first had to define what a species is and classify all living\norganisms into species. To argue that lions and tigers evolved from a\ncommon feline ancestor, you first have to define \u201clions\u201d and \u201ctigers.\u201d21 This\nturned out to be a difficult and never-ending job, because animals, plants,\nand other organisms often trespass the boundaries of their allotted drawers.\nEvolution cannot be easily contained in any bureaucratic schema. The\nwhole point of evolution is that species continually change, which means\nthat putting each species in one unchanging drawer distorts biological\nreality. For example, it is an open question when Homo erectus ended and\nHomo sapiens began. Were there once two Erectus parents whose child was\nthe first Sapiens?22 Species also keep intermingling, with animals belonging\nto seemingly separate species not only having sex but even siring fertile\noffspring. Most Sapiens living today have about 1\u20133 percent Neanderthal\nDNA,23 indicating that there once was a child whose father was a\nNeanderthal and whose mother was a Sapiens (or vice versa). So are\nSapiens and Neanderthals the same species or different species?

In a process known as horizontal gene transfer, single-cell\norganisms routinely exchange genetic material not only with organisms\nfrom related species but also with organisms from entirely different genera,\nkingdoms, orders, and even domains. Bacteriologists have a very difficult\njob keeping tabs on these chimeras.28\nAnd when we reach the very edge of life and consider viruses like SARS-\nCoV-2 (responsible for COVID-19), things become even more complicated.\nViruses straddle the supposed rigid boundary between living beings and\nlifeless matter\u2014between biology and chemistry. Unlike bacteria, viruses\naren\u2019t single-cell organisms. They aren\u2019t cells at all, and don\u2019t possess any\ncellular machinery of their own. Viruses don\u2019t eat or metabolize, and cannot\nreproduce by themselves. They are tiny packets of genetic code, which are\nable to penetrate cells, hijack their cellular machinery, and instruct them to\nproduce more copies of that alien genetic code. The new copies burst out of\nthe cell to infect and hijack more cells, which is how the alien code turns\nviral. Scientists argue endlessly about whether viruses should count as life-\nforms or whether they fall outside the boundary of life.29 But this boundary\nisn\u2019t an objective reality; it is an intersubjective convention. Even if\nbiologists reach a consensus that viruses are life-forms, it wouldn\u2019t change\nanything about how viruses behave; it will only change how humans think\nabout them.\nOf course, intersubjective conventions are themselves part of reality.

That too is\nbureaucratic work, and we would face a lot of discomfort and even death if\nwe abolished that particular department. Sewage water and drinking water\nare always in danger of mixing, but luckily for us there are bureaucrats who\nkeep them separate.\nPrior to the establishment of modern sewage systems, waterborne\ninfectious diseases like dysentery and cholera killed millions of people\naround the world.30 In 1854 hundreds of London residents began dying of\ncholera. It was a relatively small outbreak, but it proved to be a turning\npoint in the history of cholera, of epidemics more generally, and of sewage.\nThe leading medical theory of the day argued that cholera epidemics were\ncaused by \u201cbad air.\u201d But the physician John Snow suspected that the cause\nwas the water supply.

In bureaucratic systems, power often\ncomes from understanding how to manipulate obscure budgetary loopholes\nand from knowing your way around the labyrinths of offices, committees,\nand subcommittees.\nThis shift in authority changed the balance of power in the world. For\nbetter or worse, literate bureaucracies tended to strengthen the central\nauthority at the expense of ordinary citizens. It\u2019s not just that documents\nand archives made it easier for the center to tax, judge, and conscript\neverybody. The difficulty of understanding bureaucratic power\nsimultaneously made it harder for the masses to influence, resist, or evade\nthe central authority. Even when bureaucracy was a benign force, providing\npeople with sewage systems, education, and security, it still tended to\nincrease the gap between rulers and ruled. The system enabled the center to\ncollect and record a lot more information about the people it governed,\nwhile the latter found it much more difficult to understand how the system\nitself worked.\nArt, which helps us understand many other aspects of life, offered only\nlimited assistance in this case. Poets, playwrights, and moviemakers have\noccasionally focused on the dynamics of bureaucratic power. However, this\nhas proven to be a very difficult story to communicate.

Life and death\nhang in the balance. A cub or chick pushed out of the nest too soon is in\ndanger of death from starvation or predation. Among humans, the fear of\nbeing neglected or abandoned by one\u2019s parents is a template not just for\nchildren\u2019s stories like Snow White, Cinderella, and Harry Potter but also for\nsome of our most influential national and religious myths. The Ramayana is\nfar from being the sole example. In Christian theology damnation is\nconceived as losing all contact with the mother church and the heavenly\nfather. Hell is a lost child crying for his or her missing parents.\nA related biological drama, which is also familiar to human children,\nmammalian cubs, and avian chicks, is \u201cFather loves me more than he loves\nyou.\u201d Biologists and geneticists have identified sibling rivalry as one of the\nkey processes of evolution.35 Siblings routinely compete for food and\nparental attention, and in some species the killing of one sibling by another\nis commonplace. About a quarter of spotted hyena cubs are killed by their\nsiblings, who typically enjoy greater parental care as a result.36 Among sand\ntiger sharks, females hold numerous embryos in their uterus. The first\nembryo that reaches about ten centimeters in length then eats all the\nothers.37 The dynamics of sibling rivalry are manifested in numerous myths\nin addition to the Ramayana, for instance in the stories of Cain and Abel,\nKing Lear, and the TV series Succession. Entire nations\u2014like the Jewish\npeople\u2014may base their identity on the claim that \u201cwe are Father\u2019s favorite\nchildren.\u201d\nThe second major plotline of the Ramayana focuses on the romantic\ntriangle formed by Prince Rama, his lover, Sita, and the demon-king\nRavana, who kidnaps Sita. \u201cBoy meets girl\u201d and \u201cboy fights boy over girl\u201d"}

The\ncultural obsession with purity originates in the evolutionary struggle to\navoid pollution. All animals are torn between the need to try new food and\nthe fear of being poisoned. Evolution therefore equipped animals with both\ncuriosity and the capacity to feel disgust on coming into contact with\nsomething toxic or otherwise dangerous.38 Politicians and prophets have\nlearned how to manipulate these disgust mechanisms. In nationalist and\nreligious myths, countries or churches are depicted as a biological body in\ndanger of being polluted by impure intruders. For centuries bigots have\noften said that ethnic and religious minorities spread diseases,39 that\nLGBTQ people are a source of pollution,40 or that women are impure.41\nDuring the Rwanda genocide of 1994, Hutu propaganda referred to the\nTutsis as cockroaches.

They\nwere forced to defecate in public because their houses lacked functioning\ntoilets. A local official later explained that their household\u2014while being\namong the poorest in the village\u2014was nevertheless excluded from the list\nof families eligible for government aid to build toilets. The children\nroutinely suffered from other caste-based discrimination, for example being\nforced to bring separate mats and utensils to school and to sit apart from the\nother pupils, so as not to \u201cpollute\u201d them.44\nThe list of biological dramas that press our emotional buttons includes\nseveral additional classics, such as \u201cWho will be alpha?\u201d \u201cUs versus them,\u201d\nand \u201cGood versus evil.\u201d These dramas, too, feature prominently in the\nRamayana, and all of them are well known to wolf packs and chimpanzee\nbands as well as to human societies. Together, these biological dramas form\nthe backbone of almost all human art and mythology. But art\u2019s dependence\non the biological dramas have made it difficult for artists to explain the\nmechanisms of bureaucracy.

While sometimes taken as an existential or\ntheological reference to the human condition in the universe and to the\nunfathomability of God, on a more mundane level the story highlights the\npotentially nightmarish character of bureaucracies, which as an insurance\nlawyer Kafka knew all too well.\nIn bureaucratic societies, the lives of ordinary people are often upended by\nunidentified officials of an unfathomable agency for incomprehensible\nreasons. Whereas stories about heroes who confront monsters\u2014from the\nRamayana to Spider-Man\u2014repackage the biological dramas of confronting\npredators and romantic rivals, the unique horror of Kafkaesque stories\ncomes from the unfathomability of the threat.

The 2015\ncomedy-drama The Big Short (based on a 2010 book by Michael Lewis)\nexplored the bureaucratic roots of the 2007\u20138 financial crisis. The movie\u2019s\narch-villains are not humans but collateralized debt obligations (CDOs),\nwhich are financial devices invented by investment bankers and understood\nby nobody else in the world.

When the war was over, Chernivtsi was annexed to Romania. In the\nlate 1930s, as Romania became a fascist dictatorship, an important plank of\nits new antisemitic policy was to conduct a Jewish census.\nIn 1936 official statistics said that 758,000 Jews lived in Romania,\nconstituting 4.2 percent of the population. The same official statistics said\nthat the total number of refugees from the U.S.S.R., Jews and non-Jews,\nwas about 11,000. In 1937 a new fascist government came to power, headed\nby Prime Minister Octavian Goga. Goga was a renowned poet as well as a\npolitician, but he quickly graduated from patriotic poetry to fake statistics\nand oppressive bureaucracy. He and his colleagues ignored the official\nstatistics and claimed that hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees were\nflooding into Romania. In several interviews Goga claimed that half a\nmillion Jews had entered Romania illegally and that the total number of\nJews in the country was 1.5 million. Government organs, far-right\nstatisticians, and popular newspapers regularly cited even higher figures.\nThe Romanian embassy in Paris, for example, claimed there were a million\nJewish refugees in Romania. Christian Romanians were gripped by mass\nhysteria that they would soon be replaced or become a minority in a Jewish-\nled country.\nGoga\u2019s government stepped in to offer a solution to the imaginary\nproblem invented by its own propaganda.

Even if no bribes were involved, the process was extremely\ncostly: any request for documentation, as well as filing the citizenship\nrequest with the authorities, involved paying fees. Finding and filing the\nright document did not guarantee success.

According\nto Christian mythology, the whole of history is an attempt to correct Adam\nand Eve\u2019s original sin. According to Marxist-Leninist thinking, even the\nworking class is likely to be fooled by its oppressors and misidentify its\nown interests, which is why it requires the leadership of a wise party\nvanguard. Bureaucracy, too, is constantly on the lookout for errors, from\nmisplaced documents to inefficient procedures. Complex bureaucratic\nsystems usually contain self-disciplinary bodies, and when a major\ncatastrophe occurs\u2014like a military defeat or a financial meltdown\u2014\ncommissions of inquiry are set up to understand what went wrong and make\nsure the same mistake is not repeated.\nIn order to function, self-correcting mechanisms need legitimacy.

In previous eras, such fantasies took a different form\u2014religion.\nIn our personal lives, religion can fulfill many different functions, like\nproviding solace or explaining the mysteries of life. But historically, the\nmost important function of religion has been to provide superhuman\nlegitimacy for the social order. Religions like Judaism, Christianity, Islam,\nand Hinduism propose that their ideas and rules were established by an\ninfallible superhuman authority, and are therefore free from all possibility\nof error, and should never be questioned or changed by fallible humans.\nTAKING HUMANS OUT OF THE LOOP\nAt the heart of every religion lies the fantasy of connecting to a superhuman\nand infallible intelligence. This is why, as we shall explore in chapter 8,\nstudying the history of religion is highly relevant to present-day debates\nabout AI. In the history of religion, a recurrent problem is how to convince\npeople that a certain dogma indeed originated from an infallible\nsuperhuman source. Even if in principle I am eager to submit to the gods\u2019\nwill, how do I know what the gods really want?\nThroughout history many humans claimed to convey messages from the\ngods, but the messages often contradicted each other. One person said a god\nappeared to her in a dream; another person said she was visited by an angel;\na third recounted how he met a spirit in a forest\u2014and each preached a\ndifferent message. The anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse recounts how\nwhen he was doing fieldwork among the Baining people of New Britain in\nthe late 1980s, a young man called Tanotka fell sick, and in his feverish\ndelirium began making cryptic statements like \u201cI am Wutka\u201d and \u201cI am a\npost.\u201d Most of these statements were heard only by Tanotka\u2019s older brother,\nBaninge, who began telling about them to other people and interpreting\nthem in a creative way. Baninge said that his brother was possessed by an\nancestral spirit called Wutka and that he was divinely chosen to be the main\nsupport of the community, just as local houses were supported by a central"}
{"page": 103, "content": "post.\nAfter Tanotka recovered, he continued to deliver cryptic messages from\nWutka, which were interpreted by Baninge in ever more elaborate ways.\nBaninge also began having dreams of his own, which allegedly revealed\nadditional divine messages. He claimed that the end of the world was\nimminent, and convinced many of the locals to grant him dictatorial powers\nso that he could prepare the community for the coming apocalypse. Baninge\nproceeded to waste almost all the community\u2019s resources on extravagant\nfeasts and rituals. When the apocalypse didn\u2019t materialize and the\ncommunity almost starved, Baninge\u2019s power collapsed. Though some locals\ncontinued to believe that he and Tanotka were divine messengers, many\nothers concluded that the two were charlatans\u2014or perhaps the servants of\nthe Devil.3\nHow could people distinguish the true will of the gods from the inventions\nor imaginations of fallible humans? Unless you had a personal divine\nrevelation, knowing what the gods said meant trusting what fallible humans\nlike Tanotka and Baninge claimed the gods said. But how can you trust\nthese humans, especially if you don\u2019t know them personally? Religion\nwants to take fallible humans out of the loop and give people access to\ninfallible superhuman laws, but religion repeatedly boiled down to trusting\nthis or that human.\nOne way around this problem was to create religious institutions that\nvetted the purported divine messengers. Already in tribal societies\ncommunication with superhuman entities like tribal spirits was often the\ndomain of religious experts. Among the Baining people, specialized spirit\nmediums known as agungaraga were traditionally responsible for\ncommunicating with the spirits and thereby learning the hidden causes of\nmisfortunes ranging from illness to crop failure. Their membership in an\nestablished institution made the agungaraga more trustworthy than Tanotka\nand Baninge, and made their authority more stable and widely\nacknowledged.4 Among the Kalapalo tribe of Brazil religious rituals were"}

Priests and oracles had to train long and hard for\nthe important task of representing the gods, so people no longer needed to\ntrust just any layperson who claimed to have met an angel or to carry a\ndivine message.6 In ancient Greece, for example, if you wanted to know\nwhat the gods said, you went to an accredited expert like the Pythia\u2014the\nhigh priestess at the temple of Apollo in Delphi.\nBut as long as religious institutions like oracular temples were staffed by\nfallible humans, they too were open to error and corruption. Herodotus\nrecounts that when Athens was ruled by the tyrant Hippias, the pro-\ndemocracy faction bribed the Pythia to help them. Whenever any Spartan\ncame to the Pythia to consult the gods on either official or private matters,\nthe Pythia invariably replied that the Spartans must first free Athens from\nthe tyrant. The Spartans, who were Hippias\u2019s allies, eventually submitted to\nthe alleged will of the gods and sent an army to Athens that deposed\nHippias in 510 BCE, leading to the establishment of Athenian democracy.7\nIf a human prophet could falsify the words of a god, then the key problem\nof religion wasn\u2019t solved by creating religious institutions like temples and\npriestly orders. People still needed to trust fallible humans in order to access\nthe supposedly infallible gods. Was it possible to somehow bypass the\nhumans altogether?\nTHE INFALLIBLE TECHNOLOGY\nHoly books like the Bible and the Quran are a technology to bypass human\nfallibility, and religions of the book\u2014like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\n\u2014have been built around that technological artifact. To appreciate how this\ntechnology is meant to work, we should begin by explaining what a book is\nand what makes books different from other kinds of written texts. A book is"}

This makes a book\nsomething different from oral tales, from bureaucratic documents, and from\narchives. When telling a story orally, every time we tell the story it might be\na little different, and if many people tell the story over a long time,\nsignificant variations are bound to creep in. In contrast, all copies of a book\nare supposed to be identical. As for bureaucratic documents, they tend to be\nrelatively short, and often exist only as a single copy in one archive. If a\nlong document has many copies placed in numerous archives, we would\nnormally call it a book. Finally, a book that contains many texts is also\ndifferent from an archive, because each archive contains a different\ncollection of texts, whereas all copies of a book contain the same chapters,\nthe same stories, or the same recipes. The book thereby ensures that many\npeople in many times and places can access the same database.\nThe book became an important religious technology in the first\nmillennium BCE. After tens of thousands of years in which gods spoke to\nhumans via shamans, priests, prophets, oracles, and other human\nmessengers, religious movements like Judaism began arguing that the gods\nspeak through this novel technology of the book. There is one specific book\nwhose many chapters allegedly contain all the divine words about\neverything from the creation of the universe to food regulations.

What if they cannot reach a\nconsensus? What if they later change their minds? Nevertheless, this was\nthe procedure used to compile holy books like the Hebrew Bible.\nTHE MAKING OF THE HEBREW BIBLE\nDuring the first millennium BCE, Jewish prophets, priests, and scholars\nproduced an extensive collection of stories, documents, prophecies, poems,\nprayers, and chronicles. The Bible as a single holy book didn\u2019t exist in\nbiblical times. King David or the prophet Isaiah never saw a copy of the\nBible.\nIt is sometimes claimed, erroneously, that the oldest surviving copy of the\nBible comes from the Dead Sea Scrolls. These scrolls are a collection of\nabout nine hundred different documents, written mostly in the last two\ncenturies BCE and found in various caves around Qumran, a village near\nthe Dead Sea.8 Most scholars believe they constituted the archive of a\nJewish sect that lived nearby.9\nSignificantly, none of the scrolls contains a copy of the Bible, and no\nscroll indicates that the twenty-four books of the Old Testament were\nconsidered a single and complete database. Some of the scrolls certainly\nrecord texts that are today part of the canonical Bible. For example,\nnineteen scrolls and fragmentary manuscripts preserve parts of the book of\nGenesis.10 But many scrolls record texts that were later excluded from the\nBible. For example, more than twenty scrolls and fragments preserve parts\nof the book of Enoch\u2014a book allegedly written by the patriarch Enoch, the\ngreat-grandfather of Noah, and containing the history of the angels and\ndemons as well as a prophecy about the coming of the Messiah.11 The Jews\nof Qumran apparently gave great importance to both Genesis and Enoch,\nand did not think that Genesis was canonical while Enoch was apocryphal.12"}
{"page": 107, "content": "Indeed, to this day some Ethiopian Jewish and Christian sects consider\nEnoch part of their canon.13\nEven the scrolls that record future canonical texts sometimes differ from\nthe present-day canonical version. For example, the canonical text of\nDeuteronomy 32:8 says that God divided the nations of the earth according\nto \u201cthe number of the sons of Israel.\u201d The version recorded in the Dead Sea\nScrolls has \u201cthe number of the sons of God\u201d instead, implying a rather\nstartling notion that God has multiple sons.14 In Deuteronomy 8:6 the\ncanonical text requires the faithful to fear God, whereas the Dead Sea\nversion asks them to love God.15 Some variations are much more substantial\nthan just a single word here or there. The Psalms scrolls contain several\nentire psalms that are missing from the canonical Bible (most notably\nPsalms 151, 154, 155).16\nSimilarly, the oldest translation of the Bible\u2014the Greek Septuagint\u2014\ncompleted between the third and the first centuries BCE, is different in\nmany ways from the later canonical version.17 It includes, for example, the\nbooks of Tobit, Judith, Sirach, Maccabees, the Wisdom of Solomon, the\nPsalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.18 It also has longer versions of Daniel\nand Esther.19 Its book of Jeremiah is 15 percent shorter than the canonical\nversion.20 Finally, in Deuteronomy 32:8 most Septuagint manuscripts have\neither \u201csons of God\u201d or \u201cangels of God\u201d rather than \u201csons of Israel.\u201d21\nIt took centuries of hairsplitting debates among learned Jewish sages\u2014\nknown as rabbis\u2014to streamline the canonical database and to decide which\nof the many texts in circulation would get into the Bible as the official word\nof Jehovah and which would be excluded. By the time of Jesus agreement\nwas probably reached on most of the texts, but even a century later rabbis\nwere still arguing whether the Song of Songs should be part of the canon or\nnot. Some rabbis condemned that text as secular love poetry, while Rabbi\nAkiva (d. 135 CE) defended it as the divinely inspired creation of King\nSolomon.

The book of Malachi got the seal of approval; the book\nof Baruch did not. Chronicles, yes; Maccabees, no.\nInterestingly, some books mentioned in the Bible itself failed to get into\nthe canon. For example, the books of Joshua and Samuel both refer to a\nvery ancient sacred text known as the book of Jasher (Joshua 10:13, 2\nSamuel 1:18). The book of Numbers refers to \u201cthe Book of the Wars of the\nLord\u201d (Numbers 21:14).

The books of Iddo, Ahijah, and Nathan, as well as the\nbooks of Jasher and the Wars of the Lord, aren\u2019t in the canonical Bible.\nApparently, they were not excluded on purpose; they just got lost.25\nAfter the canon was sealed, most Jews gradually forgot the role of human\ninstitutions in the messy process of compiling the Bible. Jewish Orthodoxy\nmaintained that God personally handed down to Moses at Mount Sinai the\nentire first part of the Bible, the Torah. Many rabbis further argued that God\ncreated the Torah at the very dawn of time so that even biblical characters\nwho lived before Moses\u2014like Noah and Adam\u2014read and studied it.26 The\nother parts of the Bible also came to be seen as a divinely created or\ndivinely inspired text, totally different from ordinary human compilations.\nOnce the holy book was sealed, it was hoped that Jews now had direct\naccess to Jehovah\u2019s exact words, which no fallible human or corrupt"}

First, disseminating\nmany copies of the holy book promised to democratize religion and place\nstrict limits on the power of would-be human autocrats. Whereas the\narchives of Egyptian pharaohs and Assyrian kings empowered the\nunfathomable kingly bureaucracy at the expense of the masses, the Jewish\nholy book seemed to give power to the masses, who could now hold even\nthe most brazen leader accountable to God\u2019s laws.\nSecond, and more important, having numerous copies of the same book\nprevented any meddling with the text.

For the\nholy book to work its magic, Jews needed to have many copies wherever\nthey lived. With Jewish centers emerging not only in Palestine but also in\nMesopotamia and Egypt, and with new Jewish communities extending from\ncentral Asia to the Atlantic, how to make sure that copyists working\nthousands of kilometers apart would not change the holy book either on\npurpose or by mistake?"}
{"page": 110, "content": "To forestall such problems, the rabbis who canonized the Bible devised\npainstaking regulations for copying the holy book. For example, a scribe\nwas not allowed to pause at certain critical moments in the copying process.\nWhen writing the name of God, the scribe \u201cmay not respond even if the\nking greets him. If he was about to write two or three divine names\nsuccessively, he may pause between them and respond.\u201d28 Rabbi Yishmael\n(second century CE) told one copyist, \u201cYou are doing Heaven\u2019s work, and if\nyou delete one letter or add one letter\u2014you destroy the entire world.\u201d29 In\ntruth, copying errors crept in without destroying the entire world, and no\ntwo ancient Bibles were identical.30\nA second and much bigger problem concerned interpretation. Even when\npeople agree on the sanctity of a book and on its exact wording, they can\nstill interpret the same words in different ways. The Bible says that you\nshould not work on the Sabbath.

Is it okay to read a book on the Sabbath?\nHow about writing a book? How about tearing a piece of paper? The rabbis\nruled that reading a book isn\u2019t work, but tearing paper is work, which is\nwhy nowadays Orthodox Jews prepare a stack of already ripped toilet paper\nto use on the Sabbath.\nThe holy book also says that you should not cook a young goat in its\nmother\u2019s milk (Exodus 23:19). Some people interpreted this quite literally:\nif you slaughter a young goat, don\u2019t cook it in the milk of its own mother.\nBut it\u2019s fine to cook it in the milk of an unrelated goat, or in the milk of a\ncow. Other people interpreted this prohibition much more broadly to mean\nthat meat and dairy products should never be mixed, so you are not allowed\nto have a milkshake after fried chicken. As unlikely as this may sound, most\nrabbis ruled that the second interpretation is the correct one, even though\nchickens don\u2019t lactate.\nMore problems resulted from the fact that even if the technology of the\nbook succeeded in limiting changes to the holy words, the world beyond the"}

A particularly\nlarge Jewish community grew in the port of Alexandria, one of the richest\nmetropolises of the Roman Empire. A Jewish shipping magnate living in\nAlexandria would have found that many of the biblical laws were irrelevant\nto his life while many of his pressing questions had no clear answers in the\nholy text.

In contrast, when he contemplated\nwhether it was kosher for him to sail his Rome-bound grain ships on the\nSabbath, it turned out that long sea voyages were not considered by the\nauthors of Leviticus and Deuteronomy.31\nInevitably, the holy book spawned numerous interpretations, which were\nfar more consequential than the book itself. As Jews increasingly argued\nover the interpretation of the Bible, rabbis gained more power and prestige.\nWriting down the word of Jehovah was supposed to limit the authority of\nthe old priestly institution, but it gave rise to the authority of a new\nrabbinical institution.

Today many Orthodox\nJews firmly believe that the Mishnah was handed to Moses by Jehovah on\nMount Sinai, passed orally from generation to generation, until it was\nwritten down in the third century CE.33\nAlas, no sooner had the Mishnah been canonized and copied than Jews\nbegan arguing about the correct interpretation of the Mishnah.

For example, when electrical appliances developed in the twentieth\ncentury, Jews struggled with numerous unprecedented questions such as\nwhether it is okay to press the electrical buttons of an elevator on the\nSabbath?\nThe Orthodox answer is no.

Originally, it was a religion of priests and\ntemples, focused on rituals and sacrifices. In biblical times, the\nquintessential Jewish scene was a priest in blood-splattered robes\nsacrificing a lamb on the altar of Jehovah. Over the centuries, however,\nJudaism became an \u201cinformation religion,\u201d obsessed with texts and\ninterpretations. From second-century Alexandria to twenty-first-century\nBrooklyn, the quintessential Jewish scene became a group of rabbis arguing\nabout the interpretation of a text.\nThis change was extremely surprising given that almost nowhere in the\nBible itself do you find anyone arguing about the interpretation of any text.\nSuch debates were not part of biblical culture itself. For example, when\nKorah and his followers challenged the right of Moses to lead the people of\nIsrael, and demanded a more equitable division of power, Moses reacted not\nby entering a learned discussion or by quoting some scriptural passage.\nRather, Moses called upon God to perform a miracle, and the moment he\nfinished speaking, the ground split, \u201cand the earth opened its mouth and\nswallowed them and their households\u201d (Numbers 16:31\u201332). When Elijah\nwas challenged by 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah to a\npublic test in front of the people of Israel, he proved the superiority of\nJehovah over Baal and Asherah first by miraculously summoning fire from\nthe sky and then by slaughtering the pagan prophets.

The flood of texts generated\nby rabbis was increasingly seen as more important, and even more real,\nthan plowing a field, baking a loaf of bread, or sacrificing a lamb in a\ntemple. After the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans and all\ntemple rituals ceased, rabbis nevertheless devoted enormous efforts to\nwriting texts about the proper way to conduct temple rituals and then\narguing about the correct interpretation of these texts. Centuries after the\ntemple was no more, the amount of information concerning these virtual\nrituals only continued to increase. The rabbis weren\u2019t oblivious to this\nseeming gap between text and reality. Rather, they maintained that writing\ntexts about the rituals and arguing about these texts were far more important\nthan actually performing the rituals.38\nThis eventually led the rabbis to believe that the entire universe was an\ninformation sphere\u2014a realm composed of words and running on the\nalphabetical code of the Hebrew letters. They further maintained that this\ninformational universe was created so that Jews could read texts and argue\nabout their interpretation, and that if Jews ever stop reading these texts and\narguing about them, the universe will cease to exist.39 In everyday life, this\nview meant that for the rabbis words in texts were often more important\nthan facts in the world.

But already before the rabbis\nsealed this block, the dissenters rejected the authority of the entire\nrabbinical institution, which led them to subsequently reject the Mishnah\nand Talmud, too. These dissenters were the Christians.\nWhen Christianity emerged in the first century CE, it was not a unified\nreligion, but rather a variety of Jewish movements that didn\u2019t agree on\nmuch, except that they all regarded Jesus Christ\u2014rather than the rabbinical\ninstitution\u2014as the ultimate authority on Jehovah\u2019s words.40 Christians\naccepted the divinity of texts like Genesis, Samuel, and Isaiah, but they\nargued that the rabbis misunderstood these texts, and only Jesus and his\ndisciples knew the true meaning of passages like \u201cthe Lord himself will\ngive you a sign: the almah will conceive and give birth to a son, and will\ncall him Immanuel\u201d (Isaiah 7:14). The rabbis said almah meant \u201cyoung\nwoman,\u201d Immanuel meant \u201cGod with us\u201d (in Hebrew immanu means \u201cwith\nus\u201d and el means \u201cGod\u201d), and the entire passage was interpreted as a divine\npromise to help the Jewish people in their struggle against oppressive\nforeign empires. In contrast, the Christians argued that almah meant\n\u201cvirgin,\u201d that Immanuel meant that God will literally be born among\nhumans, and that this was a prophecy about the divine Jesus being born on\nearth to the Virgin Mary.41\nHowever, by rejecting the rabbinical institution while simultaneously\naccepting the possibility of new divine revelations, the Christians opened\nthe door to chaos. In the first century CE, and even more so in the second\nand third centuries CE, different Christians came up with radically new\ninterpretations for books like Genesis and Isaiah, as well as with a plethora\nof new messages from God. Since they rejected the authority of the rabbis,\nsince Jesus was dead and couldn\u2019t adjudicate between them, and since a\nunified Christian church didn\u2019t yet exist, who could decide which of all\nthese interpretations and messages was divinely inspired?\nThus, it was not just John who described the end of the world in his"}

Christians needed a curation institution. That\u2019s how the\nNew Testament was created. At roughly the same time that debates among\nJewish rabbis were producing the Mishnah and Talmud, debates between\nChristian priests, bishops, and theologians were producing the New\nTestament.\nIn a letter from 367 CE, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria recommended\ntwenty-seven texts that faithful Christians should read\u2014a rather eclectic\ncollection of stories, letters, and prophecies written by different people in\ndifferent times and places.

But the\nconsequences were far-reaching. While churches made decisions about\ntexts, the texts themselves shaped the churches. As a key example, consider\nthe role of women in the church. Some early Christian leaders saw women\nas intellectually and ethically inferior to men, and argued that women\nshould be restricted to subordinate roles in society and in the Christian\ncommunity. These views were reflected in texts like the First Epistle to\nTimothy.\nIn one of its passages, this text, attributed to Saint Paul, says, \u201cA woman\nshould learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to\nteach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was\nformed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the\nwoman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved\nthrough childbearing\u2014if they continue in faith, love and holiness with\npropriety\u201d (2:11\u201315). But modern scholars as well as some ancient\nChristian leaders like Marcion have considered this letter a second-century\nforgery, ascribed to Saint Paul but actually written by someone else.54\nIn opposition to 1 Timothy, during the second, third, and fourth centuries\nCE there were important Christian texts that saw women as equal to men,\nand even authorized women to occupy leadership roles, like the Gospel of\nMary55 or the Acts of Paul and Thecla. The latter text was written at about\nthe same time as 1 Timothy, and for a time was extremely popular.56 It\nnarrates the adventures of Saint Paul and his female disciple Thecla,\ndescribing how Thecla not only performed numerous miracles but also\nbaptized herself with her own hands and often preached. For centuries,\nThecla was one of the most revered Christian saints and was seen as\nevidence that women could baptize, preach, and lead Christian"}

By choosing to\ninclude 1 Timothy in their recommendation list while rejecting the Acts of\nPaul and Thecla, the assembled bishops and theologians shaped Christian\nattitudes toward women down to the present day. We can only hypothesize\nwhat Christianity might have looked like if the New Testament had\nincluded the Acts of Paul and Thecla instead of 1 Timothy. Perhaps in\naddition to church fathers like Athanasius, the church would have had\nmothers, while misogyny would have been labeled a dangerous heresy\nperverting Jesus\u2019s message of universal love.\nJust as most Jews forgot that rabbis curated the Old Testament, so most\nChristians forgot that church councils curated the New Testament, and came\nto view it simply as the infallible word of God. But while the holy book was\nseen as the ultimate source of authority, the process of curating the book\nplaced real power in the hands of the curating institution. In Judaism the\ncanonization of the Old Testament and Mishnah went hand in hand with\ncreating the institution of the rabbinate. In Christianity the canonization of\nthe New Testament went hand in hand with the creation of a unified\nChristian church. Christians trusted church officials\u2014like Bishop\nAthanasius\u2014because of what they read in the New Testament, but they had\nfaith in the New Testament because this is what the bishops told them to\nread.

{"page": 120, "content": "need to interpret Christian holy books empowered the church. The same\nsaying of Jesus or the same Pauline epistle could be understood in various\nways, and it was the institution that decided which reading was correct. The\ninstitution in turn was repeatedly shaken by struggles over the authority to\ninterpret the holy book, which resulted in institutional schisms such as that\nbetween the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nAll Christians read the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew\nand learned that we should love our enemies, that we should turn the other\ncheek, and that the meek shall inherit the earth. But what did that actually\nmean? Christians could read this as a call to reject all use of military force,58\nor to reject all social hierarchies.59 The Catholic Church, however, viewed\nsuch pacifists and egalitarian readings as heresies. It interpreted Jesus\u2019s\nwords in a way that allowed the church to become the richest landowner in\nEurope, to launch violent crusades, and to establish murderous inquisitions.\nCatholic theology accepted that Jesus told us to love our enemies, but\nexplained that burning heretics was an act of love, because it deterred\nadditional people from adopting heretical views, thereby saving them from\nthe flames of hell. The French inquisitor Jacques Fournier wrote in the early\nfourteenth century an entire treatise on the Sermon on the Mount that\nexplained how the text provided justification for hunting heretics.60\nFournier\u2019s view was not a fringe notion. He went on to become Pope\nBenedict XII (1334\u201342).\nFournier\u2019s task as inquisitor, and later as pope, was to ensure that the\nCatholic Church\u2019s interpretation of the holy book would prevail. In this,\nFournier and his fellow churchmen used not only violent coercion but also\ntheir control of book production. Prior to the advent of letterpress printing\nin Europe in the fifteenth century, making many copies of a book was a\nprohibitive enterprise for all but the most wealthy individuals and\ninstitutions. The Catholic Church used its power and wealth to disseminate\ncopies of its favored texts while prohibiting the production and spread of\nwhat it considered erroneous ones."}
{"page": 121, "content": "Of course, the church couldn\u2019t prevent the occasional freethinker from\nformulating heretical ideas. But because it controlled key nodes in the\nmedieval information network\u2014such as copying workshops, archives, and\nlibraries\u2014it could prevent such a heretic from making and distributing a\nhundred copies of her book. To get an idea of the difficulties faced by a\nheretical author seeking to disseminate her views, consider that when\nLeofric was made bishop of Exeter in 1050, he found just five books in the\ncathedral\u2019s library. He immediately established a copying workshop in the\ncathedral, but in the twenty-two years before he died in 1072, his copyists\nproduced only sixty-six additional volumes.61 In the thirteenth century the\nlibrary of Oxford University consisted of a few books kept in a chest under\nSt. Mary\u2019s Church. In 1424 the library of Cambridge University boasted a\ngrand total of only 122 books.62 An Oxford University decree from 1409\nstipulated that \u201call recent texts\u201d studied at the university must be\nunanimously approved \u201cby a panel of twelve theologians appointed by the\narchbishop.\u201d63\nThe church sought to lock society inside an echo chamber, allowing the\nspread only of those books that supported it, and people trusted the church\nbecause almost all the books supported it.

If anyone thought this was due to some\nunique flaw of the Jewish rabbis or the Catholic priests, the Protestant\nReformation repeated the experiment again and again\u2014always getting the\nsame results. Luther, Calvin, and their successors argued that there was no\nneed for any fallible human institution to interpose itself between ordinary\npeople and the holy book. Christians should abandon all the parasitical\nbureaucracies that grew around the Bible and reconnect to the original word\nof God. But the word of God never interpreted itself, which is why not only\nLutherans and Calvinists but numerous other Protestant sects eventually\nestablished their own church institutions and invested them with the\nauthority to interpret the text and persecute heretics.64\nIf infallible texts merely lead to the rise of fallible and oppressive\nchurches, how then to deal with the problem of human error? The naive\nview of information posits that the problem can be solved by creating the\nopposite of a church\u2014namely, a free market of information. The naive view\nexpects that if all restrictions on the free flow of information are removed,\nerror will inevitably be exposed and displaced by truth. As noted in the\nprologue, this is wishful thinking. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper to understand\nwhy. As a test case, consider what happened during one of the most\ncelebrated epochs in the history of information networks: the European\nprint revolution. The introduction of the printing press to Europe in the mid-\nfifteenth century made it possible to mass-produce texts relatively quickly,\ncheaply, and secretly, even if the Catholic Church disapproved of them. It is\nestimated that in the forty-six years from 1454 to 1500 more than twelve\nmillion volumes were printed in Europe. By contrast, in the previous"}
{"page": 123, "content": "thousand years only about eleven million volumes were hand copied.65 By\n1600, all kinds of fringe people\u2014heretics, revolutionaries, proto-scientists\n\u2014could disseminate their writings much more rapidly, widely, and easily\nthan ever before.\nIn the history of information networks, the print revolution of early\nmodern Europe is usually hailed as a moment of triumph, breaking the\nstranglehold that the Catholic Church had maintained over the European\ninformation network. Allegedly, by allowing people to exchange\ninformation much more freely than before, it led to the scientific revolution.\nThere is a grain of truth in this. Without print, it would certainly have been\nmuch harder for Copernicus, Galileo, and their colleagues to develop and\nspread their ideas.\nBut print wasn\u2019t the root cause of the scientific revolution. The only thing\nthe printing press did was to faithfully reproduce texts. The machine had no\nability to come up with any new ideas of its own. Those who connect print\nto science assume that the mere act of producing and spreading more\ninformation inevitably leads people to the truth. In fact, print allowed the\nrapid spread not only of scientific facts but also of religious fantasies, fake\nnews, and conspiracy theories. Perhaps the most notorious example of the\nlatter was the belief in a worldwide conspiracy of satanic witches, which led\nto the witch-hunt craze that engulfed early modern Europe.66\nBelief in magic and in witches has characterized human societies in all\ncontinents and eras, but different societies imagined witches and reacted to\nthem in very different ways. Some societies believed that witches controlled\nspirits, talked with the dead, and predicted the future; others imagined that\nwitches stole cattle and located hidden treasure. In one community witches\nwere thought to cause disease, blight cornfields, and concoct love potions,\nwhile in another community they supposedly entered houses at night,\nperformed household chores, and stole milk. In some locales witches were\nthought to be mostly female, while in others they were generally imagined\nto be male. Some cultures were terrified of witches and persecuted them"}
{"page": 124, "content": "violently, but others tolerated or even honored them. Finally, there were\nsocieties in every continent and era that gave witches little importance.67\nFor most of the Middle Ages, most European societies belonged to the\nlatter category and were not overly concerned about witches. The medieval\nCatholic Church didn\u2019t see them as a major threat to humanity, and some\nchurchmen actively discouraged witch-hunting. According to the influential\ntenth-century text Canon Episcopi\u2014which defined medieval church\ndoctrine on the matter\u2014witchcraft was mostly illusion, and belief in the\nreality of witchcraft was an unchristian superstition.68 The European witch-\nhunt craze was a modern rather than a medieval phenomenon.\nIn the 1420s and 1430s churchmen and scholars operating mainly in the\nAlps region took elements from Christian religion, local folklore, and\nGreco-Roman heritage and amalgamated them into a new theory of\nwitchcraft.69 Previously, even when witches were dreaded, they were\nconsidered a strictly local problem\u2014isolated criminals who, inspired by\npersonal malevolence, used magical means to commit theft and murder. In\ncontrast, the new scholarly model argued that witches were a far more\nformidable threat to society. There was allegedly a global conspiracy of\nwitches, led by Satan, which constituted an institutionalized anti-Christian\nreligion. Its purpose was nothing less than the complete destruction of the\nsocial order and of humankind. Witches were said to gather at night in huge\ndemonic assemblies, where they worshipped Satan, killed children, ate\nhuman flesh, engaged in orgies, and cast spells that caused storms,\nepidemics, and other catastrophes.\nInspired by such ideas, the first mass witch hunts and witch trials were led\nby local churchmen and noblemen in the Valais region of the western Alps\nbetween 1428 and 1436, leading to the execution of more than two hundred\nsupposed male and female witches. From this Alpine heartland, rumors\nabout the global witch conspiracy trickled to other parts of Europe, but the\nbelief was still far from mainstream, the Catholic establishment did not\nembrace it, and other regions didn\u2019t launch large-scale witch hunts like"}
{"page": 125, "content": "those in the Valais.\nIn 1485, a Dominican friar and inquisitor called Heinrich Kramer\nembarked on a witch-hunting expedition in another Alpine region\u2014the\nAustrian Tyrol. Kramer was a fervent convert to the new belief in a global\nsatanic conspiracy.70 He also seems to have been mentally unhinged, and his\naccusations of satanic witchcraft were colored by rabid misogyny and odd\nsexual fixations. Local church authorities, led by the bishop of Brixen, were\nskeptical of Kramer\u2019s accusations and alarmed by his activities. They\nstopped his inquisition, released the suspects he arrested, and expelled him\nfrom the area.71\nKramer hit back through the printing press. Within two years of his\nbanishment, he compiled and published the Malleus Maleficarum\u2014The\nHammer of the Witches. This was a do-it-yourself guidebook to exposing\nand killing witches in which Kramer described in detail the worldwide\nconspiracy and the means by which honest Christians could uncover and\nfoil the witches. In particular, he recommended the use of horrific methods\nof torture in order to extract confessions from people suspected of\nwitchcraft, and was adamant that the only punishment for the guilty was\nexecution.\nKramer organized and codified previous ideas and stories and added many\ndetails from his own fertile and hate-filled imagination. Relying on ancient\nChristian misogynist teachings like those of 1 Timothy, Kramer sexualized\nwitchcraft. He argued that witches were typically female, because\nwitchcraft originated in lust, which was supposedly stronger in women. He\nwarned readers that sex could cause a pious woman to become a witch and\nher husband to become bewitched.72\nAn entire chapter of the Hammer is dedicated to the ability of witches to\nsteal men\u2019s penises. Kramer discusses at length whether the witches are\nreally able to take away the male member from its owner, or whether they\nare only able to create an illusion of castration in men\u2019s minds. Kramer\nasks, \u201cWhat is to be thought of those witches who in this way sometimes"}

She told the afflicted man to climb a certain tree, and that he might\ntake which he liked out of the nest in which there were several members.\nAnd when he tried to take a big one, the witch said: You must not take that\none; adding, because it belongs to a parish priest.\u201d73 Numerous notions\nabout witches that are still popular today\u2014for instance, that witches are\npredominantly women, that witches engage in wild sexual activities, and\nthat witches kill and mutilate children\u2014were given their canonical form by\nKramer\u2019s book.\nLike the bishop of Brixen, other churchmen were initially skeptical of\nKramer\u2019s wild ideas, and there was some resistance to the book among\nchurch experts.74 But The Hammer of the Witches became one of the biggest\nbest sellers of early modern Europe. It catered to people\u2019s deepest fears, as\nwell as to their lurid interest in hearing about orgies, cannibalism, child\nmurders, and satanic conspiracies. The book had gone through eight\neditions by 1500, another five by 1520, and sixteen more by 1670, with\nmany vernacular translations.75 It became the definitive work on witchcraft\nand witch-hunting and inspired a host of imitations and elaborations. As\nKramer\u2019s fame grew, his work was embraced by the church experts. Kramer\nwas appointed papal representative and made inquisitor of Bohemia and\nMoravia in 1500. Even today his ideas continue to shape the world, and\nmany current theories about a global satanic conspiracy\u2014like QAnon\u2014\ndraw upon and perpetuate his fantasies.\nWhile it would be an exaggeration to argue that the invention of print\ncaused the European witch-hunt craze, the printing press played a pivotal\nrole in the rapid dissemination of the belief in a global satanic conspiracy.\nAs Kramer\u2019s ideas gained popularity, printing presses produced not only"}
{"page": 127, "content": "many additional copies of The Hammer of the Witches and copycat books\nbut also a torrent of cheap one-page pamphlets, whose sensational texts\nwere often accompanied by illustrations depicting people attacked by\ndemons or witches burned at the stake.76 These publications also gave\nfantastic statistics about the size of the witches\u2019 conspiracy. For example,\nthe Burgundian judge and witch-hunter Henri Boguet (1550\u20131619)\nspeculated that there were 300,000 witches in France alone and 1.8 million\nin all of Europe.77 Such claims fueled mass hysteria, which in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries led to the torture and execution of between\n40,000 and 50,000 innocent people who were accused of witchcraft.78 The\nvictims included individuals from all walks of life and ages, including\nchildren as young as five.79\nPeople began denouncing one another for witchcraft on the flimsiest\nevidence, often to avenge personal slights or to gain economic and political\nadvantage. Once an official investigation began, the accused were often\ndoomed. The inquisitorial methods recommended by The Hammer of the\nWitches were truly diabolical. If the accused confessed to being a witch,\nthey were executed and their property divided between the accuser, the\nexecutioner, and the inquisitors. If the accused refused to confess, this was\ntaken as evidence of their demonic obstinacy, and they were then tortured in\nhorrendous ways, their fingers broken, their flesh cut with hot pincers, their\nbodies stretched to the breaking point or submerged in boiling water.\nSooner or later they could stand it no longer and confessed\u2014and were duly\nexecuted.80\nTo take one example, in 1600 authorities in Munich arrested on suspicion\nof witchcraft the Pappenheimer family\u2014father Paulus, mother Anna, two\ngrown sons, and a ten-year-old boy, Hansel. The inquisitors began by\ntorturing little Hansel. The protocol of the interrogation, which can still be\nread in the Munich archives, has a note from one of the interrogators\nregarding the ten-year-old boy: \u201cMay be tortured to the limit so that he\nincriminates his mother.\u201d81 After being tortured in unspeakable ways, the"}

The ten-year-old Hansel was forced to watch all this. Four\nmonths later, he too was executed.82 The witch-hunters were extremely\nthorough in their search for the devil and his accomplices. But if the witch-\nhunters really wanted to find diabolical evil, they just had to look in the\nmirror.\nTHE SPANISH INQUISITION TO THE RESCUE\nWitch hunts seldom ended by killing just one person or one family. Since\nthe underlying model postulated a global conspiracy, people accused of\nwitchcraft were tortured to name accomplices. This was then used as\nevidence to imprison, torture, and execute others. If any officials, scholars,\nor churchmen voiced objections to these absurd methods, this could be seen\nas proof that they too must be witches\u2014which led to their own arrest and\ntorture.\nFor example, in 1453\u2014when belief in the satanic conspiracy was just\nbeginning to take hold\u2014a French doctor of theology called Guillaume\nEdelin bravely sought to quash it before it spread. He repeated the claims of\nthe medieval Canon Episcopi that witchcraft was an illusion and that\nwitches couldn\u2019t really fly at night to meet Satan and make a pact with him.\nEdelin was then himself accused of being a witch and arrested. Under\ntorture he confessed that he personally had flown on a broomstick and\nsigned a pact with the devil and that it was Satan who commissioned him to\npreach that witchcraft was an illusion. His judges were lenient with him; he\nwas spared execution and got life imprisonment instead.83"}
{"page": 129, "content": "The witch hunts illustrate the dark side of creating an information sphere.\nAs with rabbinical discussions of the Talmud and scholastic discussions of\nChristian scriptures, the witch hunts were fueled by an expanding ocean of\ninformation that instead of representing reality created a new reality.\nWitches were not an objective reality. Nobody in early modern Europe had\nsex with Satan or was capable of flying on broomsticks and creating\nhailstorms. But witches became an intersubjective reality. Like money,\nwitches were made real by exchanging information about witches.\nAn entire witch-hunting bureaucracy dedicated itself to such exchanges.\nTheologians, lawyers, inquisitors, and the owners of printing presses made\na living by collecting and producing information about witches, cataloging\ndifferent species of witches, investigating how witches behaved, and\nrecommending how they could be exposed and defeated. Professional\nwitch-hunters offered their services to governments and municipalities,\ncharging large sums of money. Archives were filled by detailed reports of\nwitch-hunting expeditions, protocols of witch trials, and lengthy\nconfessions extracted from the alleged witches.\nExpert witch-hunters used all that data to refine their theories further. Like\nscholars arguing about the correct interpretation of scripture, the witch-\nhunters debated the correct interpretation of The Hammer of the Witches\nand other influential books. The witch-hunting bureaucracy did what\nbureaucracy often does: it invented the intersubjective category of\n\u201cwitches\u201d and imposed it on reality. It even printed forms, with standard\naccusations and confessions of witchcraft and blank spaces left for dates,\nnames, and the signature of the accused. All that information produced a lot\nof order and power; it was a means for certain people to gain authority and\nfor society as a whole to discipline its members.

If everybody said so, it must be true. As\ndiscussed in chapter 2, humans are susceptible to adopting fake memories.\nAt least some early modern Europeans dreamed or fantasized about\nsummoning devils, having sex with Satan, and practicing witchcraft, and\nwhen accused of being witches, they confused their dreams and fantasies\nwith reality.84\nConsequently, even as the witch hunts reached their ghastly crescendo in\nthe early seventeenth century, and many people suspected that something\nwas clearly wrong, it was difficult to reject the whole thing as pure fantasy.\nOne of the worst witch-hunting episodes in early modern Europe occurred\nin the towns of Bamberg and W\u00fcrzburg in southern Germany in the late\n1620s. In Bamberg, a city of fewer than 12,000 at the time,85 up to 900\ninnocent people were executed from 1625 to 1631.86 In W\u00fcrzburg another\n1,200 people were tortured and killed, out of a population of around\n11,500.87 In August 1629, the chancellor of the prince-bishop of W\u00fcrzburg\nwrote a letter to a friend about the ongoing witch hunt, in which he\nconfessed his doubts about the matter. The letter is worth quoting at length:\nAs to the affair of the witches \u2026 it has started up afresh, and no words\ncan do justice to it.

A few days ago a Dean\nwas arrested; two others who were summoned have fled. The notary of\nour Church consistory, a very learned man, was yesterday arrested and"}

She will be followed\nby seven or eight others of the best and most attractive persons.\u2026 And\nthus many are put to death for renouncing God and being at the witch-\ndances, against whom nobody has ever else spoken a word.\nTo conclude this wretched matter, there are children of three and four\nyears, to the number of three hundred, who are said to have had\nintercourse with the Devil. I have seen put to death children of seven,\npromising students of ten, twelve, fourteen, and fifteen.\u2026 [B]ut I cannot\nand must not write more of this misery.\nThe chancellor then added this interesting postscript to the letter:\nThough there are many wonderful and terrible things happening, it is\nbeyond doubt that, at a place called the Fraw-Rengberg, the Devil in\nperson, with eight thousand of his followers, held an assembly and\ncelebrated mass before them all, administering to his audience (that is,\nthe witches) turnip-rinds and parings in place of the Holy Eucharist.\nThere took place not only foul but most horrible and hideous\nblasphemies, whereof I shudder to write.88\nEven after expressing his horror at the insanity of the witch hunt in\nW\u00fcrzburg, the chancellor nevertheless expressed his firm belief in the\nsatanic conspiracy of witches. He didn\u2019t witness any witchcraft firsthand,\nbut so much information about witches was circulating that it was difficult\nfor him to doubt all of it. Witch hunts were a catastrophe caused by the\nspread of toxic information. They are a prime example of a problem that\nwas created by information, and was made worse by more information."}

Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas, a Spanish\ninquisitor, made a thorough investigation of witch hunts and witch trials in\nthe early seventeenth century.

It can just as easily lead to the spread of lies\nand fantasies and to the creation of toxic information spheres. More\nspecifically, a completely free market of ideas may incentivize the\ndissemination of outrage and sensationalism at the expense of truth. It is not\ndifficult to understand why. Printers and booksellers made a lot more\nmoney from the lurid tales of The Hammer of the Witches than they did\nfrom the dull mathematics of Copernicus\u2019s On the Revolutions of the\nHeavenly Spheres.

The third edition\ndid not appear until 1617.

Is\nit possible to establish better curation institutions that use their power to\nfurther the pursuit of truth rather than to accumulate more power for\nthemselves?\nEarly modern Europe saw the foundation of exactly such curation\ninstitutions, and it was these institutions\u2014rather than the printing press or\nspecific books like On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres\u2014that\nconstituted the bedrock of the scientific revolution. These key curation\ninstitutions were not the universities. Many of the most important leaders of\nthe scientific revolution were not university professors. Nicolaus\nCopernicus, Robert Boyle, Tycho Brahe, and Ren\u00e9 Descartes, for example,\nheld no academic positions. Nor did Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley,\nVoltaire, Diderot, or Rousseau.\nThe curation institutions that played a central role in the scientific\nrevolution connected scholars and researchers both in and out of\nuniversities, forging an information network that spanned the whole of\nEurope and eventually the world. For the scientific revolution to gather\npace, scientists had to trust information published by colleagues in distant\nlands. This kind of trust in the work of people whom one had never met was\nevident in scientific associations like the Royal Society of London for\nImproving Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, and the French Acad\u00e9mie\ndes Sciences (1666); scientific journals like the Philosophical Transactions"}

These institutions curated information on the basis\nof empirical evidence, bringing attention to the discoveries of Copernicus\nrather than to the fantasies of Kramer. When a paper was submitted to the\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the lead question the\neditors asked was not, \u201cHow many people would pay to read this?\u201d but,\n\u201cWhat proof is there that it is true?\u201d\nAt first, these new institutions seemed as flimsy as cobwebs, lacking the\npower necessary to reshape human society. Unlike the witch-hunting\nexperts, the editors of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\ncould not torture and execute anyone. And unlike the Catholic Church, the\nAcad\u00e9mie des Sciences did not command huge territories and budgets. But\nscientific institutions did accrue influence thanks to a very original claim to\ntrust. A church typically told people to trust it because it possessed the\nabsolute truth, in the form of an infallible holy book. A scientific institution,\nin contrast, gained authority because it had strong self-correcting\nmechanisms that exposed and rectified the errors of the institution itself. It\nwas these self-correcting mechanisms, not the technology of printing, that\nwere the engine of the scientific revolution.\nIn other words, the scientific revolution was launched by the discovery of\nignorance.91 Religions of the book assumed that they had access to an\ninfallible source of knowledge. The Christians had the Bible, the Muslims\nhad the Quran, the Hindus had the Vedas, and the Buddhists had the\nTipitaka. Scientific culture has no comparable holy book, nor does it claim\nthat any of its heroes are infallible prophets, saints, or geniuses. The\nscientific project starts by rejecting the fantasy of infallibility and\nproceeding to construct an information network that takes error to be\ninescapable. Sure, there is much talk about the genius of Copernicus,\nDarwin, and Einstein, but none of them is considered faultless. They all\nmade mistakes, and even the most celebrated scientific tracts are sure to"}

Science is a team effort, relying on institutional\ncollaboration rather than on individual scientists or, say, a single infallible\nbook. Of course, institutions too are prone to error. Scientific institutions\nare nevertheless different from religious institutions, inasmuch as they\nreward skepticism and innovation rather than conformity. Scientific\ninstitutions are also different from conspiracy theories, inasmuch as they\nreward self-skepticism. Conspiracy theorists tend to be extremely skeptical\nregarding the existing consensus, but when it comes to their own beliefs,\nthey lose all their skepticism and fall prey to confirmation bias.92 The\ntrademark of science is not merely skepticism but self-skepticism, and at\nthe heart of every scientific institution we find a strong self-correcting\nmechanism. Scientific institutions do reach a broad consensus about the\naccuracy of certain theories\u2014such as quantum mechanics or the theory of\nevolution\u2014but only because these theories have managed to survive intense\nefforts to disprove them, launched not only by outsiders but by members of\nthe institution itself.\nSELF-CORRECTING MECHANISMS\nAs an information technology, the self-correcting mechanism is the polar\nopposite of the holy book. The holy book is supposed to be infallible. The\nself-correcting mechanism embraces fallibility. By self-correcting, I refer to\nmechanisms that an entity uses to correct itself. A teacher correcting a\nstudent\u2019s essay is not a self-correcting mechanism; the student isn\u2019t\ncorrecting their own essay. A judge sending a criminal to prison is not a\nself-correcting mechanism; the criminal isn\u2019t exposing their own crime.\nWhen the Allies defeated and dismantled the Nazi regime, this was not a\nself-correcting mechanism; left to its own devices, Germany would not\nhave denazified itself.

Children learn how\nto walk thanks to them. You make a wrong move, you fall, you learn from\nyour mistake, you try doing it a little differently. Sure, sometimes parents\nand teachers give the child a hand or offer advice, but a child who relies\nentirely on such external corrections or keeps excusing mistakes instead of\nlearning from them will find it very difficult to walk. Indeed, even as adults,\nevery time we walk, our body engages in an intricate process of self-\ncorrection. As our body navigates through space, internal feedback loops\nbetween brain, limbs, and sensory organs keep our legs and hands in their\nproper place and our balance just right.93\nMany other bodily processes require constant self-correction. Our blood\npressure, temperature, sugar levels, and numerous other parameters must be\ngiven some leeway to change in accordance with varying circumstances,\nbut they should never go above or below certain critical thresholds. Our\nblood pressure needs to increase when we run, to decrease when we sleep,\nbut must always keep within certain bounds.94 Our body manages this\ndelicate biochemical dance through a host of homeostatic self-correcting\nmechanisms. If our blood pressure goes too high, the self-correcting\nmechanisms lower it. If our blood pressure is dangerously low, the self-\ncorrecting mechanisms raise it. If the self-correcting mechanisms go out of\norder, we could die.95\nInstitutions, too, die without self-correcting mechanisms. These\nmechanisms start with the realization that humans are fallible and\ncorruptible. But instead of despairing of humans and looking for a way to\nbypass them, the institution actively seeks its own errors and corrects them.\nAll institutions that manage to endure beyond a handful of years possess\nsuch mechanisms, but institutions differ greatly in the strength and visibility\nof their self-correcting mechanisms.\nFor example, the Catholic Church is an institution with relatively weak"}

It is occasionally willing to acknowledge that some\nof its members have erred or sinned, but the institution itself allegedly\nremains perfect. For example, in the Second Vatican Council in 1964, the\nCatholic Church acknowledged that \u201cChrist summons the Church to\ncontinual reformation as she sojourns here on earth. The Church is always\nin need of this, insofar as she is an institution of men here on earth. Thus if,\nin various times and circumstances, there have been deficiencies in moral\nconduct or in church discipline, or even in the way that church teaching has\nbeen formulated\u2014to be carefully distinguished from the deposit of faith\nitself\u2014these can and should be set right at the opportune moment.\u201d96\nThis admission sounds promising, but the devil is in the details,\nspecifically in the refusal to countenance the possibility of any deficiency in\n\u201cthe deposit of faith.\u201d In Catholic dogma \u201cthe deposit of faith\u201d refers to the\nbody of revealed truth that the church has received from scriptures and from\nits sacred tradition of interpreting scripture. The Catholic Church\nacknowledges that priests are fallible humans who can sin and can also\nmake mistakes in the way they formulate church teachings. However, the\nholy book itself can never err. What does this imply about the entire church\nas an institution that combines fallible humans with an infallible text?\nAccording to Catholic dogma, biblical infallibility and divine guidance\ntrump human corruption, so even though individual members of the church\nmay err and sin, the Catholic Church as an institution is never wrong.\nAllegedly, never in history did God allow the majority of church leaders to\nmake a serious mistake in their interpretation of the holy book. This\nprinciple is common to many religions. Jewish Orthodoxy accepted the\npossibility that the rabbis who composed the Mishnah and Talmud might\nhave erred in personal matters, but when they came to decree religious\ndoctrine, God ensured that they would make no mistake.97 In Islam there is\nan analogous principle known as Ijma.

{"page": 138, "content": "error.\u201d98\nIn Catholicism, alleged institutional perfection is enshrined most clearly in\nthe doctrine of papal infallibility, which says that while in personal matters\npopes may err, in their institutional role they are infallible.99 For example,\nPope Alexander VI erred in breaking his vow of celibacy, having a mistress\nand siring several children, yet when defining official church teachings on\nmatters of ethics or theology, he was incapable of mistake.\nIn line with these views, the Catholic Church has always employed a self-\ncorrecting mechanism to supervise its human members in their personal\naffairs, but it never developed a mechanism for amending the Bible or for\namending its \u201cdeposit of faith.\u201d This attitude is manifest in the few formal\napologies the Catholic Church issued for its past conduct. In recent decades,\nseveral popes apologized for the mistreatment of Jews, women, non-\nCatholic Christians, and indigenous cultures, as well as for more specific\nevents such as the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 and the abuse of\nchildren in Catholic schools. It is commendable that the Catholic Church\nmade such apologies at all; religious institutions rarely do so. Nevertheless,\nin all these cases, the popes were careful to shift responsibility away from\nscriptures and from the church as an institution. Instead, the blame was laid\non the shoulders of individual churchmen who misinterpreted scriptures and\ndeviated from the true teachings of the church.\nFor example, in March 2000, Pope John Paul II conducted a special\nceremony in which he asked forgiveness for a long list of historical crimes\nagainst Jews, heretics, women, and indigenous people. He apologized \u201cfor\nthe use of violence that some have committed in the service of truth.\u201d This\nterminology implied that the violence was the fault of \u201csome\u201d misguided\nindividuals who didn\u2019t understand the truth taught by the church. The pope\ndidn\u2019t accept the possibility that perhaps these individuals understood\nexactly what the church was teaching and that these teachings just were not\nthe truth.100\nSimilarly, when Pope Francis apologized in 2022 for the abuses against"}

The fault lay\nwith \u201cmany members of the church,\u201d not with the church and its teachings.\nAs if it were never official church doctrine to destroy indigenous cultures\nand forcefully convert people.\nIn fact, it wasn\u2019t a few wayward priests who launched the Crusades,\nimposed laws that discriminated against Jews and women, or orchestrated\nthe systematic annihilation of indigenous religions throughout the world.102\nThe writings of many revered church fathers, and the official decrees of\nmany popes and church councils, are full of passages disparaging \u201cpagan\u201d\nand \u201cheretical\u201d religions, calling for their destruction, discriminating\nagainst their members, and legitimizing the use of violence to convert\npeople to Christianity.103 For example, in 1452 Pope Nicholas V issued the\nDum Diversas bull, addressed to King Afonso V of Portugal and other\nCatholic monarchs. The bull said, \u201cWe grant you by these present\ndocuments, with our Apostolic Authority, full and free permission to invade,\nsearch out, capture, and subjugate the Saracens and pagans and any other\nunbelievers and enemies of Christ wherever they may be, as well as their\nkingdoms, duchies, counties, principalities, and other property \u2026 and to\nreduce their persons into perpetual servitude.\u201d104 This official proclamation,\nrepeated numerous times by subsequent popes, laid the theological basis for\nEuropean imperialism and the destruction of native cultures across the\nworld. Of course, though the church doesn\u2019t acknowledge it officially, over\ntime it has changed its institutional structures, its core teachings, and its\ninterpretation of scripture. The Catholic Church of today is far less\nantisemitic and misogynist than it was in medieval and early modern times.\nPope Francis is far more tolerant of indigenous cultures than Pope Nicholas\nV. There is an institutional self-correcting mechanism at work here, which\nreacts both to external pressures and to internal soul-searching. But what"}
{"page": 140, "content": "characterizes self-correcting in institutions like the Catholic Church is that\neven when it happens, it is denied rather than celebrated. The first rule of\nchanging church teachings is that you never admit changing church\nteachings.\nYou would never hear a pope announcing to the world, \u201cOur experts have\njust discovered a really big error in the Bible. We\u2019ll soon issue an updated\nedition.\u201d Instead, when asked about the church\u2019s more generous attitude to\nJews or women, popes imply that this was always what the church really\ntaught, even if some individual churchmen previously failed to understand\nthe message correctly. Denying the existence of self-correction doesn\u2019t\nentirely stop it from happening, but it does weaken and slow it. Because the\ncorrection of past mistakes is not acknowledged, let alone celebrated, when\nthe faithful encounter another serious problem in the institution and its\nteachings, they are paralyzed by fear of changing something that is\nsupposedly eternal and infallible. They cannot benefit from the example of\nprevious changes.\nFor instance, when Catholics like Pope Francis himself are now\nreconsidering the church\u2019s teachings on homosexuality,105 they find it\ndifficult to simply acknowledge past mistakes and change the teachings. If\neventually a future pope would issue an apology for the mistreatment of\nLGBTQ people, the way to do it would be to again shift the blame to the\nshoulders of some overzealous individuals who misunderstood the gospel.\nTo maintain its religious authority the Catholic Church has had no choice\nbut to deny the existence of institutional self-correction. For the church fell\ninto the infallibility trap. Once it based its religious authority on a claim to\ninfallibility, any public admission of institutional error\u2014even on relatively\nminor issues\u2014could completely destroy its authority.\nTHE DSM AND THE BIBLE\nIn contrast to the Catholic Church, the scientific institutions that emerged in"}

Scientific institutions maintain that even if most scientists in a\nparticular period believe something to be true, it may yet turn out to be\ninaccurate or incomplete. In the nineteenth century most physicists accepted\nNewtonian physics as a comprehensive account of the universe, but in the\ntwentieth century the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics exposed\nthe inaccuracies and limitations of Newton\u2019s model.106 The most celebrated\nmoments in the history of science are precisely those moments when\naccepted wisdom is overturned and new theories are born.\nCrucially, scientific institutions are willing to admit their institutional\nresponsibility for major mistakes and crimes. For example, present-day\nuniversities routinely give courses, and professional journals routinely\npublish articles, that expose the institutional racism and sexism that\ncharacterized the scientific study of subjects like biology, anthropology, and\nhistory in the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries. Research on\nindividual test cases such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, and on\ngovernmental policies ranging from the White Australia policy to the\nHolocaust, have repeatedly and extensively studied how flawed biological,\nanthropological, and historical theories developed in leading scientific\ninstitutions were used to justify and facilitate discrimination, imperialism,\nand even genocide. These crimes and errors are not blamed on a few\nmisguided scholars. They are seen as an institutional failure of entire\nacademic disciplines.107\nThe willingness to admit major institutional errors contributes to the\nrelatively fast pace at which science is developing. When the available\nevidence justifies it, dominant theories are often discarded within a few\ngenerations, to be replaced by new theories. What students of biology,\nanthropology, and history learn at university in the early twenty-first\ncentury is very different from what they learned there a century previously.\nPsychiatry offers numerous similar examples for strong self-correcting\nmechanisms.

But there is a crucial difference between\nthe DSM and the Bible. First published in 1952, the DSM is revised every\ndecade or two, with the fifth edition appearing in 2013. Over the years, the\ndefinition of many disorders has changed, new ones have been added, while\nothers have been deleted. Homosexuality, for example, was listed in 1952\nas a sociopathic personality disturbance, but removed from the DSM in\n1974. It took just twenty-two years to correct this error in the DSM. That\u2019s\nnot a holy book. That\u2019s a scientific text.\nToday the discipline of psychiatry doesn\u2019t try to reinterpret the 1952\ndefinition of homosexuality in a more benign spirit. Rather, it views the\n1952 definition as a downright error. More important, the error is not\nattributed to the shortcomings of a few homophobic professors. Rather, it is\nacknowledged to be the result of deep institutional biases in the discipline\nof psychiatry.108 Confessing the past institutional errors of their discipline\nmakes psychiatrists today more careful not to commit new such errors, as\nevidenced in the heated debate regarding transgender people and people on\nthe autistic spectrum. Of course, no matter how careful they are,\npsychiatrists are still likely to make institutional mistakes. But they are also\nlikely to acknowledge and correct them.109\nPUBLISH OR PERISH\nWhat makes scientific self-correcting mechanisms particularly strong is that\nscientific institutions are not just willing to admit institutional error and\nignorance; they are actively seeking to expose them. This is evident in the\ninstitutions\u2019 incentive structure. In religious institutions, members are\nincentivized to conform to existing doctrine and be suspicious of novelty.\nYou become a rabbi, imam, or priest by professing doctrinal loyalty, and\nyou can advance up the ranks to become pope, chief rabbi, or grand\nayatollah without criticizing your predecessors or advancing any radical"}

Hiring and promotions in\nscientific institutions are based on the principle of \u201cpublish or perish,\u201d and\nto publish in prestigious journals, you must expose some mistake in existing\ntheories or discover something your predecessors and teachers didn\u2019t know.\nNobody wins a Nobel Prize for faithfully repeating what previous scholars\nsaid and opposing every new scientific theory.\nOf course, just as religion has room for self-correcting, so science has\nample room for conformism, too.

In April\n1982, while observing through an electron microscope, Shechtman saw\nsomething that all contemporary theories in chemistry claimed simply could\nnot exist: the atoms in a mixed sample of aluminum and manganese were\ncrystallized in a pattern with a five-fold rotational symmetry.

But the editors of the journal Physical Review Letters, after\nreviewing the evidence, eventually published Shechtman\u2019s article in\n1984.112 And then, as he describes it, \u201call hell broke loose.\u201d\nShechtman\u2019s claims were dismissed by most of his colleagues, and he was\nblamed for mismanaging his experiments. The head of his laboratory also\nturned on Shechtman.

He got a place in another\nlab. The evidence he presented turned out to be more convincing than the\nexisting chemistry textbooks and the views of Linus Pauling. Several\ncolleagues repeated Shechtman\u2019s experiments and replicated his findings. A\nmere ten years after Shechtman saw the quasicrystals through his\nmicroscope, the International Union of Crystallography\u2014the leading\nscientific association in the field\u2014altered its definition of what a crystal is.\nChemistry textbooks were changed accordingly, and an entire new scientific\nfield emerged\u2014the study of quasicrystals.

{"page": 149, "content": "CHAPTER 5\nDecisions: A Brief History of\nDemocracy and Totalitarianism\nD\nemocracy and dictatorship are typically discussed as contrasting\npolitical and ethical systems. This chapter seeks to shift the terms of\nthe discussion, by surveying the history of democracy and dictatorship as\ncontrasting types of information networks. It examines how information in\ndemocracies flows differently than in dictatorial systems and how inventing\nnew information technologies helps different kinds of regimes flourish.\nDictatorial information networks are highly centralized.1 This means two\nthings. First, the center enjoys unlimited authority, hence information tends\nto flow to the central hub, where the most important decisions are made. In\nthe Roman Empire all roads led to Rome, in Nazi Germany information\nflowed to Berlin, and in the Soviet Union it streamed to Moscow.\nSometimes the central government attempts to concentrate all information\nin its hands and to dictate all decisions by itself, controlling the totality of\npeople\u2019s lives. This totalizing form of dictatorship, practiced by the likes of\nHitler and Stalin, is known as totalitarianism. As we shall see, technical\ndifficulties often prevent dictators from becoming totalitarian. The Roman\nemperor Nero, for example, didn\u2019t have the technology necessary to\nmicromanage the lives of millions of peasants in remote provincial villages.\nIn many dictatorial regimes considerable autonomy is therefore left to\nindividuals, corporations, and communities. However, the dictators always\nretain the authority to intervene in people\u2019s lives. In Nero\u2019s Rome freedom"}
{"page": 150, "content": "was not an ideal but a by-product of the government\u2019s inability to exert\ntotalitarian control.\nThe second characteristic of dictatorial networks is that they assume the\ncenter is infallible. They therefore dislike any challenge to the center\u2019s\ndecisions. Soviet propaganda depicted Stalin as an infallible genius, and\nRoman propaganda treated emperors as divine beings. Even when Stalin or\nNero made a patently disastrous decision, there were no robust self-\ncorrecting mechanisms in the Soviet Union or the Roman Empire that could\nexpose the mistake and push for a better course of action.\nIn theory, a highly centralized information network could try to maintain\nstrong self-correcting mechanisms, like independent courts and elected\nlegislative bodies. But if they functioned well, these would challenge the\ncentral authority and thereby decentralize the information network.\nDictators always see such independent power hubs as threats and seek to\nneutralize them. This is what happened to the Roman Senate, whose power\nwas whittled away by successive Caesars until it became little more than a\nrubber stamp for imperial whims.2 The same fate befell the Soviet judicial\nsystem, which never dared resist the will of the Communist Party. Stalinist\nshow trials, as their name indicates, were theater with preordained results.3\nTo summarize, a dictatorship is a centralized information network, lacking\nstrong self-correcting mechanisms. A democracy, in contrast, is a\ndistributed information network, possessing strong self-correcting\nmechanisms. When we look at a democratic information network, we do\nsee a central hub. The government is the most important executive power in\na democracy, and government agencies therefore gather and store vast\nquantities of information. But there are many additional information\nchannels that connect lots of independent nodes. Legislative bodies,\npolitical parties, courts, the press, corporations, local communities, NGOs,\nand individual citizens communicate freely and directly with one another so\nthat most information never passes through any government agency and\nmany important decisions are made elsewhere. Individuals choose for"}
{"page": 151, "content": "themselves where to live, where to work, and whom to marry. Corporations\nmake their own choices about where to open a branch, how much to invest\nin certain projects, and how much to charge for goods and services.\nCommunities decide for themselves about organizing charities, sporting\nevents, and religious festivals. Autonomy is not a consequence of the\ngovernment\u2019s ineffectiveness; it is the democratic ideal.\nEven if it possesses the technology necessary to micromanage people\u2019s\nlives, a democratic government leaves as much room as possible for people\nto make their own choices. A common misconception is that in a democracy\neverything is decided by majority vote. In fact, in a democracy as little as\npossible is decided centrally, and only the relatively few decisions that must\nbe made centrally should reflect the will of the majority. In a democracy, if\n99 percent of people want to dress in a particular way and worship a\nparticular god, the remaining 1 percent should still be free to dress and\nworship differently.\nOf course, if the central government doesn\u2019t intervene at all in people\u2019s\nlives, and doesn\u2019t provide them with basic services like security, it isn\u2019t a\ndemocracy; it is anarchy. In all democracies the center raises taxes and\nmaintains an army, and in most modern democracies it also provides at least\nsome level of health care, education, and welfare. But any intervention in\npeople\u2019s lives demands an explanation. In the absence of a compelling\nreason, a democratic government should leave people to their own devices.\nAnother crucial characteristic of democracies is that they assume everyone\nis fallible. Therefore, while democracies give the center the authority to\nmake some vital decisions, they also maintain strong mechanisms that can\nchallenge the central authority. To paraphrase President James Madison,\nsince humans are fallible, a government is necessary, but since government\ntoo is fallible, it needs mechanisms to expose and correct its errors, such as\nholding regular elections, protecting the freedom of the press, and\nseparating the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.\nConsequently, while a dictatorship is about one central information hub"}
{"page": 152, "content": "dictating everything, a democracy is an ongoing conversation between\ndiverse information nodes. The nodes often influence each other, but in\nmost matters they are not obliged to reach a consensus. Individuals,\ncorporations, and communities can continue to think and behave in different\nways. There are, of course, cases when everyone must behave the same, and\ndiversity cannot be tolerated. For example, when in 2002\u20133 Americans\ndisagreed about whether to invade Iraq, everyone ultimately had to abide by\na single decision. It was unacceptable that some Americans would maintain\na private peace with Saddam Hussein while others declared war. Whether\ngood or bad, the decision to invade Iraq committed every American citizen.\nSo also when initiating national infrastructure projects or defining criminal\noffenses. No country can function well if every person is allowed to lay a\nseparate rail network or to have their own definition of murder.\nIn order to make decisions on such collective matters, a countrywide\npublic conversation must first be held, following which the people\u2019s\nrepresentatives\u2014elected in free and fair elections\u2014make a choice. But\neven after that choice has been made, it should remain open to\nreexamination and correction. While the network cannot change its previous\nchoices, it can elect a different government next time.\nMAJORITY DICTATORSHIP\nThe definition of democracy as a distributed information network with\nstrong self-correcting mechanisms stands in sharp contrast to a common\nmisconception that equates democracy only with elections. Elections are a\ncentral part of the democratic tool kit, but they are not democracy. In the\nabsence of additional self-correcting mechanisms, elections can easily be\nrigged. Even if the elections are completely free and fair, by itself this too\ndoesn\u2019t guarantee democracy. For democracy is not the same thing as\nmajority dictatorship.\nSuppose that in a free and fair election 51 percent of voters choose a"}

Clearly it is not. The problem isn\u2019t that genocide demands\na special majority of more than 51 percent. It\u2019s not that if the government\ngets the backing of 60 percent, 75 percent, or even 99 percent of voters,\nthen its death camps finally become democratic. A democracy is not a\nsystem in which a majority of any size can decide to exterminate unpopular\nminorities; it is a system in which there are clear limits on the power of the\ncenter.\nSuppose 51 percent of voters choose a government that then takes away\nthe voting rights of the other 49 percent of voters, or perhaps of just 1\npercent of them. Is that democratic? Again the answer is no, and it has\nnothing to do with the numbers. Disenfranchising political rivals dismantles\none of the vital self-correcting mechanisms of democratic networks.\nElections are a mechanism for the network to say, \u201cWe made a mistake;\nlet\u2019s try something else.\u201d But if the center can disenfranchise people at will,\nthat self-correcting mechanism is neutered.\nThese two examples may sound outlandish, but they are unfortunately\nwithin the realm of the possible. Hitler began sending Jews and communists\nto concentration camps within months of rising to power through\ndemocratic elections, and in the United States numerous democratically\nelected governments have disenfranchised African Americans, Native\nAmericans, and other oppressed populations. Of course, most assaults on\ndemocracy are more subtle. The careers of strongmen like Vladimir Putin,\nViktor Orb\u00e1n, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Rodrigo Duterte, Jair Bolsonaro, and\nBenjamin Netanyahu demonstrate how a leader who uses democracy to rise\nto power can then use his power to undermine democracy. As Erdo\u011fan once\nput it, \u201cDemocracy is like a tram. You ride it until you arrive at your\ndestination, then you step off.\u201d4\nThe most common method strongmen use to undermine democracy is to\nattack its self-correcting mechanisms one by one, often beginning with the"}
{"page": 154, "content": "courts and the media. The typical strongman either deprives courts of their\npowers or packs them with his loyalists and seeks to close all independent\nmedia outlets while building his own omnipresent propaganda machine.5\nOnce the courts are no longer able to check the government\u2019s power by\nlegal means, and once the media obediently parrots the government line, all\nother institutions or persons who dare oppose the government can be\nsmeared and persecuted as traitors, criminals, or foreign agents. Academic\ninstitutions, municipalities, NGOs, and private businesses are either\ndismantled or brought under government control. At that stage, the\ngovernment can also rig the elections at will, for example by jailing popular\nopposition leaders, preventing opposition parties from participating in the\nelections, gerrymandering election districts, or disenfranchising voters.\nAppeals against these antidemocratic measures are dismissed by the\ngovernment\u2019s handpicked judges. Journalists and academics who criticize\nthese measures are fired. The remaining media outlets, academic\ninstitutions, and judicial authorities all praise these measures as necessary\nsteps to protect the nation and its allegedly democratic system from traitors\nand foreign agents. The strongmen don\u2019t usually take the final step of\nabolishing the elections outright. Instead, they keep them as a ritual that\nserves to provide legitimacy and maintain a democratic facade, as happens,\nfor example, in Putin\u2019s Russia.\nSupporters of strongmen often don\u2019t see this process as antidemocratic.\nThey are genuinely baffled when told that electoral victory doesn\u2019t grant\nthem unlimited power. Instead, they see any check on the power of an\nelected government as undemocratic. However, democracy doesn\u2019t mean\nmajority rule; rather, it means freedom and equality for all. Democracy is a\nsystem that guarantees everyone certain liberties, which even the majority\ncannot take away.\nNobody disputes that in a democracy the representatives of the majority\nare entitled to form the government and to advance their preferred policies\nin myriad fields.

Major decisions about foreign affairs, defense, education, taxation,\nand numerous other policies are all in the hands of the majority.\nBut in a democracy, there are two baskets of rights that are protected from\nthe majority\u2019s grasp. One contains human rights. Even if 99 percent of the\npopulation wants to exterminate the remaining 1 percent, in a democracy\nthis is forbidden, because it violates the most basic human right\u2014the right\nto life. The basket of human rights contains many additional rights, such as\nthe right to work, the right to privacy, freedom of movement, and freedom\nof religion. These rights enshrine the decentralized nature of democracy,\nmaking sure that as long as people don\u2019t harm anyone, they can live their\nlives as they see fit.\nThe second crucial basket of rights contains civil rights. These are the\nbasic rules of the democratic game, which enshrine its self-correcting\nmechanisms. An obvious example is the right to vote. If the majority were\npermitted to disenfranchise the minority, then democracy would be over\nafter a single election. Other civil rights include freedom of the press,\nacademic freedom, and freedom of assembly, which enable independent\nmedia outlets, universities, and opposition movements to challenge the\ngovernment. These are the key rights that strongmen seek to violate. While\nsometimes it is necessary to make changes to a country\u2019s self-correcting\nmechanisms\u2014for example, by expanding the franchise, regulating the\nmedia, or reforming the judicial system\u2014such changes should be made\nonly on the basis of a broad consensus including both majority and minority\ngroups. If a small majority could unilaterally change civil rights, it could\neasily rig elections and get rid of all other checks on its power.\nAn important thing to note about both human rights and civil rights is that\nthey don\u2019t just limit the power of the central government; they also impose\non it many active duties. It is not enough for a democratic government to\nabstain from infringing on human and civil rights. It must take actions to"}
{"page": 156, "content": "ensure them. For example, the right to life imposes on a democratic\ngovernment the duty to protect citizens from criminal violence. If a\ngovernment doesn\u2019t kill anyone, but also makes no effort to protect citizens\nfrom murder, this is anarchy rather than democracy.\nTHE PEOPLE VERSUS THE TRUTH\nOf course, in every democracy, there are lengthy discussions concerning the\nexact limits of human and civil rights. Even the right to life has limits.\nThere are democratic countries like the United States that impose the death\npenalty, thereby denying some criminals the right to life. And every country\nallows itself the prerogative to declare war, thereby sending people to kill\nand be killed. So where exactly does the right to life end? There are also\ncomplicated and ongoing discussions concerning the list of rights that\nshould be included in the two baskets. Who determined that freedom of\nreligion is a basic human right? Should internet access be defined as a civil\nright? And what about animal rights? Or the rights of AI?\nWe cannot resolve these matters here. Both human and civil rights are\nintersubjective conventions that humans invent rather than discover, and\nthey are determined by historical contingencies rather than universal reason.\nDifferent democracies can adopt somewhat different lists of rights. At least\nfrom the viewpoint of information flows, what defines a system as\n\u201cdemocratic\u201d is only that its center doesn\u2019t have unlimited authority and\nthat the system possesses robust mechanisms to correct the center\u2019s\nmistakes. Democratic networks assume that everyone is fallible, and that\nincludes even the winners of elections and the majority of voters.\nIt is particularly crucial to remember that elections are not a method for\ndiscovering truth. Rather, they are a method for maintaining order by\nadjudicating between people\u2019s conflicting desires. Elections establish what\nthe majority of people desire, rather than what the truth is.

These arguments carried the\nday. In October 2002 the elected representatives of the American people in\nCongress voted overwhelmingly to authorize the invasion. The resolution\npassed with a 296 to 133 majority (69 percent) in the House of\nRepresentatives and a 77 to 23 majority (77 percent) in the Senate.6 In the\nearly days of the war in March 2003, polls found that the elected\nrepresentatives were indeed in tune with the mass of voters and that 72\npercent of American citizens supported the invasion.7 The will of the\nAmerican people was clear.\nBut the truth turned out to be different from what the government said and\nwhat the majority believed. As the war progressed, it became evident that\nIraq had no weapons of mass destruction and that many Iraqis had no wish\nto be \u201cliberated\u201d by the Americans or to establish a democracy. By August\n2004 another poll found that 67 percent of Americans believed that the\ninvasion was based on incorrect assumptions.

Unlike parliaments,\ndepartments of environmental studies should not reflect the will of the\nmajority.\nOf course, when it comes to making policy decisions about climate\nchange, in a democracy the will of the voters should reign supreme.\nAcknowledging the reality of climate change does not tell us what to do\nabout it.

Choosing\nbetween these two options is a question of desire, and should therefore be\ndone by all voters rather than by a limited group of experts.\nBut the one option that should not be on offer in elections is hiding or\ndistorting the truth.

Allowing the government to supervise the search for\ntruth is like appointing the fox to guard the chicken coop.\nTo discover the truth, it is better to rely on two other methods. First,\nacademic institutions, the media, and the judiciary have their own internal\nself-correcting mechanisms for fighting corruption, correcting bias, and\nexposing error. In academia, peer-reviewed publication is a far better check\non error than supervision by government officials, because academic\npromotion often depends on uncovering past mistakes and discovering\nunknown facts. In the media, free competition means that if one outlet\ndecides not to break a scandal, perhaps for self-serving reasons, others are\nlikely to jump at the scoop. In the judiciary, a judge that takes bribes may be\ntried and punished just like any other citizen.\nSecond, the existence of several independent institutions that seek the\ntruth in different ways allows these institutions to check and correct one\nanother. For example, if powerful corporations manage to break down the\npeer-review mechanism by bribing a sufficiently large number of scientists,\ninvestigative journalists and courts can expose and punish the perpetrators.\nIf the media or the courts are afflicted by systematic racist biases, it is the\njob of sociologists, historians, and philosophers to expose these biases.\nNone of these mechanisms are completely fail-safe, but no human\ninstitution is. Government certainly isn\u2019t.\nTHE POPULIST ASSAULT\nIf all this sounds complicated, it is because democracy should be\ncomplicated.

In contrast, democracy"}
{"page": 160, "content": "is a conversation with numerous participants, many of them talking at the\nsame time. It can be hard to follow such a conversation.\nMoreover, the most important democratic institutions tend to be\nbureaucratic behemoths. Whereas citizens avidly follow the biological\ndramas of the princely court and the presidential palace, they often find it\ndifficult to understand how parliaments, courts, newspapers, and\nuniversities function. This is what helps strongmen mount populist attacks\non institutions, dismantle all self-correcting mechanisms, and concentrate\npower in their hands. We discussed populism briefly in the prologue, to help\nexplain the populist challenge to the naive view of information. Here we\nneed to revisit populism, get a broader understanding of its worldview, and\nexplain its appeal to antidemocratic strongmen.\nThe term \u201cpopulism\u201d derives from the Latin populus, which means \u201cthe\npeople.\u201d In democracies, \u201cthe people\u201d is considered the sole legitimate\nsource of political authority. Only representatives of the people should have\nthe authority to declare wars, pass laws, and raise taxes. Populists cherish\nthis basic democratic principle, but somehow conclude from it that a single\nparty or a single leader should monopolize all power. In a curious political\nalchemy, populists manage to base a totalitarian pursuit of unlimited power\non a seemingly impeccable democratic principle. How does it happen?\nThe most novel claim populists make is that they alone truly represent the\npeople. Since in democracies only the people should have political power,\nand since allegedly only the populists represent the people, it follows that\nthe populist party should have all political power to itself. If some party\nother than the populists wins elections, it does not mean that this rival party\nwon the people\u2019s trust and is entitled to form a government. Rather, it\nmeans that the elections were stolen or that the people were deceived to\nvote in a way that doesn\u2019t express their true will.\nIt should be stressed that for many populists, this is a genuinely held belief\nrather than a propaganda gambit. Even if they win just a small share of\nvotes, populists may still believe they alone represent the people. An"}
{"page": 161, "content": "analogous case are communist parties. In the U.K., for example, the\nCommunist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) never won more than 0.4\npercent of votes in a general election,9 but was nevertheless adamant that it\nalone truly represented the working class. Millions of British workers, they\nclaimed, were voting for the Labour Party or even for the Conservative\nParty rather than for the CPGB because of \u201cfalse consciousness.\u201d Allegedly,\nthrough their control of the media, universities, and other institutions, the\ncapitalists managed to deceive the working class into voting against its true\ninterests, and only the CPGB could see through this deception. In like\nfashion, populists can believe that the enemies of the people have deceived\nthe people to vote against its true will, which the populists alone represent.\nA fundamental part of this populist credo is the belief that \u201cthe people\u201d is\nnot a collection of flesh-and-blood individuals with various interests and\nopinions, but rather a unified mystical body that possesses a single will\n\u2014\u201cthe will of the people.\u201d Perhaps the most notorious and extreme\nmanifestation of this semireligious belief was the Nazi motto \u201cEin Volk, ein\nReich, ein F\u00fchrer,\u201d which means \u201cOne People, One Country, One Leader.\u201d\nNazi ideology posited that the Volk (people) had a single will, whose sole\nauthentic representative was the F\u00fchrer (leader). The leader allegedly had\nan infallible intuition for how the people felt and what the people wanted. If\nsome German citizens disagreed with the leader, it didn\u2019t mean that the\nleader might be in the wrong. Rather, it meant that the dissenters belonged\nto some treasonous outsider group\u2014Jews, communists, liberals\u2014instead of\nto the people.\nThe Nazi case is of course extreme, and it is grossly unfair to accuse all\npopulists of being crypto-Nazis with genocidal inclinations. However, many\npopulist parties and politicians deny that \u201cthe people\u201d might contain a\ndiversity of opinions and interest groups. They insist that the real people has\nonly one will and that they alone represent this will. In contrast, their\npolitical rivals\u2014even when the latter enjoy substantial popular support\u2014\nare depicted as \u201calien elites.\u201d Thus, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez ran for the presidency in"}

If they support the leader, they are part of the people. This, according\nto the German political philosopher Jan-Werner M\u00fcller, is the defining\nfeature of populism. What turns someone into a populist is claiming that\nthey alone represent the people and that anyone who disagrees with them\u2014\nwhether state bureaucrats, minority groups, or even the majority of voters\u2014\neither suffers from false consciousness or isn\u2019t really part of the people.12\nThis is why populism poses a deadly threat to democracy. While\ndemocracy agrees that the people is the only legitimate source of power,\ndemocracy is based on the understanding that the people is never a unitary\nentity and, therefore, cannot possess a single will. Every people\u2014whether\nGermans, Venezuelans, or Turks\u2014is composed of many different groups,\nwith a plurality of opinions, wills, and representatives. No group, including\nthe majority group, is entitled to exclude other groups from membership in\nthe people. This is what makes democracy a conversation. Holding a\nconversation presupposes the existence of several legitimate voices. If,\nhowever, the people has only one legitimate voice, there can be no\nconversation. Rather, the single voice dictates everything. Populism may\ntherefore claim adherence to the democratic principle of \u201cpeople\u2019s power,\u201d\nbut it effectively empties democracy of meaning and seeks to establish a\ndictatorship.\nPopulism undermines democracy in another, more subtle, but equally\ndangerous way. Having claimed that they alone represent the people,\npopulists argue that the people is not just the sole legitimate source of\npolitical authority but the sole legitimate source of all authority. Any\ninstitution that derives its authority from something other than the will of\nthe people is antidemocratic.

By taking the democratic principle\nof \u201cpeople\u2019s power\u201d to its extreme, populists turn totalitarian.\nIn fact, while democracy means that authority in the political sphere\ncomes from the people, it doesn\u2019t deny the validity of alternative sources of\nauthority in other spheres. As discussed above, in a democracy independent\nmedia outlets, courts, and universities are essential self-correcting\nmechanisms that protect the truth even from the will of the majority.\nBiology professors claim that humans evolved from apes because the\nevidence supports this, even if the majority wills it to be otherwise.\nJournalists can reveal that a popular politician took a bribe, and if\ncompelling evidence is presented in court, a judge may send that politician\nto jail, even if most people don\u2019t want to believe these accusations.\nPopulists are suspicious of institutions that in the name of objective truths\noverride the supposed will of the people. They tend to see this as a smoke\nscreen for elites grabbing illegitimate power. This drives populists to be\nskeptical of the pursuit of truth, and to argue\u2014as we saw in the prologue\u2014\nthat \u201cpower is the only reality.\u201d They thereby seek to undercut or\nappropriate the authority of any independent institutions that might oppose\nthem. The result is a dark and cynical view of the world as a jungle and of\nhuman beings as creatures obsessed with power alone. All social\ninteractions are seen as power struggles, and all institutions are depicted as\ncliques promoting the interests of their own members. In the populist\nimagination, courts don\u2019t really care about justice; they only protect the\nprivileges of the judges. Yes, the judges talk a lot about justice, but this is a\nploy to grab power for themselves. Newspapers don\u2019t care about facts; they\nspread fake news to mislead the people and benefit the journalists and the\ncabals that finance them.

First, since it reduces all interactions to power\nstruggles, it simplifies reality and makes events like wars, economic crises,\nand natural disasters easy to understand. Anything that happens\u2014even a\npandemic\u2014is about elites pursuing power. Second, the populist view is\nattractive because it is sometimes correct. Every human institution is indeed\nfallible and suffers from some level of corruption. Some judges do take\nbribes. Some journalists do intentionally mislead the public. Academic\ndisciplines are occasionally plagued by bias and nepotism. That is why\nevery institution needs self-correcting mechanisms. But since populists are\nconvinced that power is the only reality, they cannot accept that a court, a\nmedia outlet, or an academic discipline would ever be inspired by the value\nof truth or justice to correct itself.\nWhile many people embrace populism because they see it as an honest\naccount of human reality, strongmen are attracted to it for a different reason.\nPopulism offers strongmen an ideological basis for making themselves\ndictators while pretending to be democrats. It is particularly useful when\nstrongmen seek to neutralize or appropriate the self-correcting mechanisms\nof democracy. Since judges, journalists, and professors allegedly pursue\npolitical interests rather than truth, the people\u2019s champion\u2014the strongman\n\u2014should control these positions instead of allowing them to fall into the\nhands of the people\u2019s enemies. Similarly, since even the officials in charge\nof arranging elections and publicizing their results may be part of a\nnefarious conspiracy, they too should be replaced by the strongman\u2019s\nloyalists.\nIn a well-functioning democracy, citizens trust the results of elections, the\ndecisions of courts, the reports of media outlets, and the findings of\nscientific disciplines because citizens believe these institutions are\ncommitted to the truth. Once people think that power is the only reality,\nthey lose trust in all these institutions, democracy collapses, and the\nstrongmen can seize total power."}

How can a deep-seated distrust of all elites and institutions be\nsquared with unwavering admiration for one leader and party? This is why\npopulists ultimately depend on the mystical notion that the strongman\nembodies the people. When trust in bureaucratic institutions like election\nboards, courts, and newspapers is particularly low, an enhanced reliance on\nmythology is the only way to preserve order.\nMEASURING THE STRENGTH OF DEMOCRACIES\nStrongmen who claim to represent the people may well rise to power\nthrough democratic means, and often rule behind a democratic facade.\nRigged elections in which they win overwhelming majorities serve as proof\nof the mystical bond between the leader and the people. Consequently, to\nmeasure how democratic an information network is, we cannot use a simple\nyardstick like whether elections are being held regularly. In Putin\u2019s Russia,\nin Iran, and even in North Korea elections are held like clockwork. Rather,\nwe need to ask much more complex questions like \u201cWhat mechanisms\nprevent the central government from rigging the elections?\u201d \u201cHow safe is it\nfor leading media outlets to criticize the government?\u201d and \u201cHow much\nauthority does the center appropriate to itself?\u201d Democracy and dictatorship\naren\u2019t binary opposites, but rather a continuum. To decide whether a\nnetwork is closer to the democratic or the dictatorial end of the continuum,\nwe need to understand how information flows in the network and what\nshapes the political conversation.\nIf one person dictates all the decisions, and even their closest advisers are\nterrified to voice a dissenting view, no conversation is taking place. Such a"}

If nobody\ncan voice unorthodox opinions publicly, but behind closed doors a small\ncircle of party bosses or senior officials are able to freely express their\nviews, then this is still a dictatorship, but it has taken a baby step in the\ndirection of democracy. If 10 percent of the population participate in the\npolitical conversation by airing their opinions, voting in fair elections, and\nrunning for office, that may be considered a limited democracy, as was the\ncase in many ancient city-states like Athens, or in the early days of the\nUnited States, when only wealthy white men had such political rights. As\nthe percentage of people taking part in the conversation rises, so the\nnetwork becomes more democratic.\nThe focus on conversations rather than elections raises a host of\ninteresting questions. For example, where does that conversation take\nplace? North Korea, for example, has the Mansudae Assembly Hall in\nPyongyang, where the 687 members of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly\nmeet and talk. However, while this Assembly is officially known as North\nKorea\u2019s legislature, and while elections to the Assembly are held every five\nyears, this body is widely considered a rubber stamp, executing decisions\ntaken elsewhere. The anodyne discussions follow a predetermined script,\nand they aren\u2019t geared to change anyone\u2019s mind about anything.13\nIs there perhaps another, more private hall in Pyongyang where the crucial\nconversations take place? Do Politburo members ever dare criticize Kim\nJong Un\u2019s policies during formal meetings? Perhaps it can be done in\nunofficial dinner parties or in unofficial think tanks? Information in North\nKorea is so concentrated and so tightly controlled that we cannot provide\nclear answers to these questions.14\nSimilar questions can be asked about the United States. In the United\nStates, unlike in North Korea, people are free to say almost anything they\nwant. Scathing public attacks on the government are a daily occurrence. But\nwhere is the room where the crucial conversations happen, and who sits\nthere? The U.S. Congress was designed to fulfill this function, with the"}

But when was the last time that an eloquent speech in Congress by\na member of one party persuaded members of the other party to change\ntheir minds about anything? Wherever the conversations that shape\nAmerican politics now take place, it is definitely not in Congress.\nDemocracies die not only when people are not free to talk but also when\npeople are not willing or able to listen.\nSTONE AGE DEMOCRACIES\nBased on the above definition of democracy, we can now turn to the\nhistorical record and examine how changes in information technology and\ninformation flows have shaped the history of democracy. To judge by the\narchaeological and anthropological evidence, democracy was the most\ntypical political system among archaic hunter-gatherers. Stone Age bands\nobviously didn\u2019t have formal institutions like elections, courts, and media\noutlets, but their information networks were usually distributed and gave\nample opportunities for self-correction. In bands numbering just a few\ndozen people information could easily be shared among all group members,\nand when the band decided where to pitch camp, where to go hunting, or\nhow to handle a conflict with another band, everyone could take part in the\nconversation and dispute each other. Bands usually belonged to a larger\ntribe that included hundreds or even thousands of people. But when\nimportant choices affecting the whole tribe had to be made, such as whether\nto go to war, tribes were usually still small enough for a large percentage of\ntheir members to gather in one place and converse.15\nWhile bands and tribes sometimes had dominant leaders, these tended to\nexercise only limited authority. Leaders had no standing armies, police\nforces, or governmental bureaucracies at their disposal, so they couldn\u2019t just\nimpose their will by force.16 Leaders also found it difficult to control the\neconomic basis of people\u2019s lives. In modern times, dictators like Vladimir"}
{"page": 168, "content": "Putin and Saddam Hussein have often based their political power on\nmonopolizing economic assets like oil wells.17 In medieval and classical\nantiquity, Chinese emperors, Greek tyrants, and Egyptian pharaohs\ndominated society by controlling granaries, silver mines, and irrigation\ncanals. In contrast, in a hunter-gatherer economy such centralized economic\ncontrol was possible only under special circumstances. For example, along\nthe northwestern coast of North America some hunter-gatherer economies\nrelied on catching and preserving large numbers of salmon. Since salmon\nruns peaked for a few weeks in specific creeks and rivers, a powerful chief\ncould monopolize this asset.18\nBut this was exceptional. Most hunter-gatherer economies were far more\ndiversified. One leader, even supported by a few allies, could not corral the\nsavanna and prevent people from gathering plants and hunting animals\nthere. If all else failed, hunter-gatherers could therefore vote with their feet.\nThey had few possessions, and their most important assets were their\npersonal skills and personal friends. If a chief turned dictatorial, people\ncould just walk away.19\nEven when hunter-gatherers did end up ruled by a domineering chief, as\nhappened among the salmon-fishing people of northwestern America, at\nleast that chief was accessible. He didn\u2019t live in a faraway fortress\nsurrounded by an unfathomable bureaucracy and a cordon of armed guards.\nIf you wanted to voice a complaint or a suggestion, you could usually get\nwithin earshot of him. The chief couldn\u2019t control public opinion, nor could\nhe shut himself off from it. In other words, there was no way for a chief to\nforce all information to flow through the center, or to prevent people from\ntalking with one another, criticizing him, or organizing against him.20\nIn the millennia following the agricultural revolution, and especially after\nwriting helped create large bureaucratic polities, it became easier to\ncentralize the flow of information and harder to maintain the democratic\nconversation. In small city-states like those of ancient Mesopotamia and\nGreece, autocrats like Lugal-Zagesi of Umma and Pisistratus of Athens"}
{"page": 169, "content": "relied on bureaucrats, archives, and a standing army to monopolize key\neconomic assets and information about ownership, taxation, diplomacy, and\npolitics. It simultaneously became harder for the mass of citizens to keep in\ndirect touch with one another. There was no mass communication\ntechnology like newspapers or radio, and it was not easy to squeeze tens of\nthousands of citizens into the main city square to hold a communal\ndiscussion.\nDemocracy was still an option for these small city-states, as the history of\nboth early Sumer and classical Greece clearly indicates.21 However, the\ndemocracy of ancient city-states tended to be less inclusive than the\ndemocracy of archaic hunter-gatherer bands. Probably the most famous\nexample of ancient city-state democracy is Athens in the fifth and fourth\ncenturies BCE. All adult male citizens could participate in the Athenian\nassembly, vote on public policy, and be elected to public offices. But\nwomen, slaves, and noncitizen residents of the city did not enjoy these\nprivileges. Only about 25\u201330 percent of the adult population of Athens\nenjoyed full political rights.22\nAs the size of polities continued to increase, and city-states were\nsuperseded by larger kingdoms and empires, even Athenian-style partial\ndemocracy disappeared. All the famous examples of ancient democracies\nare city-states such as Athens and Rome. In contrast, we don\u2019t know of any\nlarge-scale kingdom or empire that operated along democratic lines.\nFor example, when in the fifth century BCE Athens expanded from a city-\nstate into an empire, it did not grant citizenship and political rights to those\nit conquered. The city of Athens remained a limited democracy, but the\nmuch bigger Athenian Empire was ruled autocratically from the center. All\nthe important decisions about taxes, diplomatic alliances, and military\nexpeditions were taken in Athens. Subject lands like the islands of Naxos\nand Thasos had to obey the orders of the Athenian popular assembly and\nelected officials, without the Naxians and Thasians being able to vote in\nthat assembly or be elected to office. It was also difficult for Naxos, Thasos,"}

Information in the Athenian Empire\nflowed to and from Athens.23\nWhen the Roman Republic built its empire, conquering first the Italian\nPeninsula and eventually the entire Mediterranean basin, the Romans took a\nsomewhat different course. Rome gradually did extend citizenship to the\nconquered people. It began by granting citizenship to the inhabitants of\nLatium, then to the inhabitants of other Italian regions, and finally to\ninhabitants of even distant provinces like Gallia and Syria. However, as\ncitizenship was extended to more people, the political rights of citizens\nwere simultaneously restricted.\nThe ancient Romans had a clear understanding of what democracy means,\nand they were originally fiercely committed to the democratic ideal. After\nexpelling the last king of Rome in 509 BCE, the Romans developed a deep\ndislike for monarchy and a fear of giving unlimited power to any single\nindividual or institution. Supreme executive power was therefore shared by\ntwo consuls who balanced each other. These consuls were chosen by\ncitizens in free elections, held office for a single year, and were additionally\nchecked by the powers of the popular assembly, of the Senate, and of other\nelected officials like the tribunes.\nBut when Rome extended citizenship to Latins, Italians, and finally to\nGauls and Syrians, the power of the popular assembly, the tribunes, the\nSenate, and even the two consuls was gradually reduced, until in the late\nfirst century BCE the Caesar family established its autocratic rule.\nAnticipating present-day strongmen like Putin, Augustus didn\u2019t crown\nhimself king, and pretended that Rome was still a republic. The Senate and\nthe popular assembly continued to convene, and every year citizens\ncontinued to choose consuls and tribunes. But these institutions were\nemptied of real power.24\nIn 212 CE, the emperor Caracalla\u2014the offspring of a Phoenician family"}
{"page": 171, "content": "from North Africa\u2014took a seemingly momentous step and granted\nautomatic Roman citizenship to all free adult males throughout the vast\nempire. Rome in the third century CE accordingly had tens of millions of\ncitizens.25 But by that time, all the important decisions were made by a\nsingle unelected emperor. While consuls were still ceremonially chosen\nevery year, Caracalla inherited power from his father Septimius Severus,\nwho became emperor by winning a civil war. To cement his rule, the most\nimportant step Caracalla took was murdering his brother and rival Geta.\nWhen Caracalla ordered the murder of Geta, decided to devalue the\nRoman currency, or declared war on the Parthian Empire, he had no need to\nask permission from the Roman people. All of Rome\u2019s self-correcting\nmechanisms had been neutralized long before. If Caracalla made some error\nin foreign or domestic policy, neither the Senate nor any officials like the\nconsuls or tribunes could intervene to correct it, except by rising in\nrebellion or assassinating him. And when Caracalla was indeed assassinated\nin 217, it only led to a new round of civil wars culminating in the rise of\nnew autocrats. Rome in the third century CE, like Russia in the eighteenth\ncentury, was, in the words of Madame de Sta\u00ebl, \u201cautocracy tempered by\nstrangulation.\u201d\nBy the third century CE, not only the Roman Empire but all other major\nhuman societies on earth were centralized information networks lacking\nstrong self-correcting mechanisms. This was true of the Parthian and\nSassanian Empires in Persia, of the Kushan and Gupta Empires in India,\nand of China\u2019s Han Empire and its successor Three Kingdoms.26 Thousands\nof more small-scale societies continued to function democratically in the\nthird century CE and beyond, but it seemed that distributed democratic\nnetworks were simply incompatible with large-scale societies.\nCAESAR FOR PRESIDENT!\nWere large-scale democracies really unworkable in the ancient world? Or"}
{"page": 172, "content": "did autocrats like Augustus and Caracalla deliberately sabotage them? This\nquestion is important not only for our understanding of ancient history but\nalso for our view of democracy\u2019s future in the age of AI. How do we know\nwhether democracies fail because they are undermined by strongmen or\nbecause of much deeper structural and technological reasons?\nTo answer that question, let\u2019s take a closer look at the Roman Empire. The\nRomans were clearly familiar with the democratic ideal, and it continued to\nbe important to them even after the Caesar family rose to power. Otherwise,\nAugustus and his heirs would not have bothered to maintain seemingly\ndemocratic institutions like the Senate or annual elections to the consulate\nand other offices. So why did power end up in the hands of an unelected\nemperor?\nIn theory, even after Roman citizenship was expanded to tens of millions\nof people throughout the Mediterranean basin, wasn\u2019t it possible to hold\nempire-wide elections for the position of emperor? This would surely have\nrequired very complicated logistics, and it would have taken several months\nto learn the results of the elections. But was that really a deal breaker?\nThe key misconception here is equating democracy with elections. If the\nRoman Empire wanted to, it could technically have held empire-wide\nelections for emperor. But the real question we should ask is whether the\nRoman Empire could have held an ongoing empire-wide political\nconversation. In present-day North Korea no democratic conversation takes\nplace because people aren\u2019t free to talk, yet we could well imagine a\nsituation when this freedom is guaranteed\u2014as it is in South Korea. In the\npresent-day United States the democratic conversation is endangered by\npeople\u2019s inability to listen to and respect their political rivals, yet this can\npresumably still be fixed. By contrast, in the Roman Empire there was\nsimply no way to conduct or sustain a democratic conversation, because the\ntechnological means to hold such a conversation did not exist.\nTo hold a conversation, it is not enough to have the freedom to talk and\nthe ability to listen. There are also two technical preconditions. First, people"}
{"page": 173, "content": "need to be within hearing range of each other. This means that the only way\nto hold a political conversation in a territory the size of the United States or\nthe Roman Empire is with the help of some kind of information technology\nthat can swiftly convey what people say over long distances.\nSecond, people need at least a rudimentary understanding of what they are\ntalking about. Otherwise, they are just making noise, not holding a\nmeaningful conversation. People usually have a good understanding of\npolitical issues of which they have direct experience. Poor people have\nmany insights about poverty that escape economics professors, and ethnic\nminorities understand racism in a much more profound way than people\nwho never suffered from it, for example. However, if lived experience were\nthe only way to understand crucial political issues, large-scale political\nconversations would be impossible. For then every group of people could\ntalk meaningfully only about its own experiences. Even worse, nobody else\ncould understand what they were saying. If lived experience is the sole\npossible source of knowledge, then merely listening to the insights gained\nfrom someone else\u2019s lived experience cannot impart these insights to me.\nThe only way to have a large-scale political conversation among diverse\ngroups of people is if people can gain some understanding of issues that\nthey have never experienced firsthand. In a large polity, it is a crucial role of\nthe education system and the media to inform people about things they have\nnever faced themselves. If there is no education system or media platforms\nto perform this role, no meaningful large-scale conversations can take place.\nIn a small Neolithic town of a few thousand inhabitants people might\nsometimes have been afraid to say what they thought, or might have refused\nto listen to their rivals, but it was relatively easy to satisfy the more\nfundamental technical preconditions for meaningful discourse. First, people\nlived in proximity to one another, so they could easily meet most other\ncommunity members and hear their voices.

When people talked about\nwar and hunger, they knew what they were saying.\nIn the fourth century BCE, the city-state of Rome was still small enough\nto allow a large percentage of its citizens to congregate in the Forum in\ntimes of emergency, listen to respected leaders, and voice their personal\nviews on the matter at hand. When in 390 BCE Gallic invaders attacked\nRome, almost everyone lost a relative in the defeat at the Battle of the Allia\nand lost property when the victorious Gauls then sacked Rome. The\ndesperate Romans appointed Marcus Camillus as dictator. In Rome, the\ndictator was a public official appointed in times of emergency who had\nunlimited powers but only for a short predetermined period, following\nwhich he was held accountable for his actions. After Camillus led the\nRomans to victory, everybody could see that the emergency was over, and\nCamillus stepped down.27\nIn contrast, by the third century CE, the Roman Empire had a population\nof between sixty and seventy-five million people,28 spread over five million\nsquare kilometers.29 Rome lacked mass communication technology like\nradio or daily newspapers. Only 10\u201320 percent of adults had reading\nskills,30 and there was no organized education system that could inform\nthem about the geography, history, and economy of the empire. True, many\npeople across the empire did share some cultural ideas, such as a strong\nbelief in the superiority of Roman civilization over the barbarians. These\nshared cultural beliefs were crucial in preserving order and holding the\nempire together. But their political implications were far from clear, and in\ntimes of crisis there was no possibility to hold a public conversation about\nwhat should be done.\nHow could Syrian merchants, British shepherds, and Egyptian villagers\nconverse about the ongoing wars in the Middle East or about the\nimmigration crisis brewing along the Danube?

{"page": 175, "content": "size of the empire and the available information technology, democracy was\nsimply unworkable. This was acknowledged already by ancient\nphilosophers like Plato and Aristotle, who argued that democracy can work\nonly in small-scale city-states.31\nIf the absence of Roman democracy had merely been the fault of\nparticular autocrats, we should have at least seen large-scale democracies\nflourishing in other places, like in Sassanian Persia, Gupta India, or Han\nChina. But prior to the development of modern information technology,\nthere are no examples of large-scale democracies anywhere.\nIt should be stressed that in many large-scale autocracies local affairs were\noften managed democratically. The Roman emperor didn\u2019t have the\ninformation needed to micromanage hundreds of cities across the empire,\nwhereas local citizens in each city could continue to hold a meaningful\nconversation about municipal politics. Consequently, long after the Roman\nEmpire became an autocracy, many of its cities continued to be governed by\nlocal assemblies and elected officials. At a time when elections to the\nconsulship in Rome became ceremonial affairs, elections to municipal\noffices in small cities like Pompeii were hotly contested.\nPompeii was destroyed in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE, during the\nreign of the emperor Titus. Archaeologists uncovered about fifteen hundred\ngraffiti concerned with various local election campaigns.

In the Tsarist Empire, for\nexample, the daily lives of millions of villagers were managed by rural\ncommunes. Going back at least to the eleventh century, each commune\nusually included fewer than a thousand people. They were subject to a\nlandlord and bore many obligations to their lord and to the central Tsarist\nstate, but they had considerable autonomy in managing their internal affairs\nand in deciding how to discharge their external obligations, such as paying\ntaxes and providing military recruits. The commune mediated local\ndisputes, provided emergency relief, enforced social norms, oversaw the\ndistribution of land to individual households, and regulated access to shared\nresources like forests and pastures. Decisions on important matters were\nmade in communal meetings in which the heads of local households\nexpressed their views and chose the commune\u2019s elder. Resolutions at least\ntried to reflect the majority\u2019s will.34\nIn Tsarist villages and Roman cities a form of democracy was possible\nbecause a meaningful public conversation was possible. Pompeii was a city\nof about eleven thousand people in 79 CE,35 so everybody could supposedly\njudge for themselves whether Lucretius Fronto was an honest man and\nwhether Marcus Cerrinius Vatia was a drunken thief.

Print made it possible to cheaply and\nquickly produce large numbers of books and pamphlets, which enabled\nmore people to voice their opinions and be heard over a large territory, even\nif the process still took time. This sustained some of the first experiments in\nlarge-scale democracy, such as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\nestablished in 1569 and the Dutch Republic established in 1579.\nSome may contest the characterization of these polities as \u201cdemocratic,\u201d\nsince only a minority of relatively wealthy citizens enjoyed full political\nrights. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, political rights were\nreserved for adult male members of the szlachta\u2014the nobility. These\nnumbered up to 300,000 individuals, or about 5 percent of the total adult\npopulation.36 One of the szlachta\u2019s prerogatives was to elect the king, but\nsince voting required traveling long distances to a national convention, few\nexercised their right. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries participation\nin royal elections usually ranged between 3,000 and 7,000 voters, except for\nthe 1669 elections in which 11,271 participated.37 While this hardly sounds\ndemocratic in the twenty-first century, it should be remembered that all\nlarge-scale democracies until the twentieth century limited political rights to\na small circle of relatively wealthy men. Democracy is never a matter of all\nor nothing. It is a continuum, and late sixteenth-century Poles and\nLithuanians explored previously unknown regions of that continuum.\nAside from electing its king, Poland-Lithuania had an elected parliament\n(the Sejm) that approved or blocked new legislation and had the power to\nveto royal decisions on taxation and foreign affairs. Moreover, citizens\nenjoyed a list of inviolable rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom\nof religion. In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, when most\nof Europe suffered from bitter religious conflicts and persecutions, Poland-\nLithuania was a tolerant haven, where Catholics, Greek Orthodox,\nLutherans, Calvinists, Jews, and even Muslims coexisted in relative\nharmony.38 In 1616, more than a hundred mosques functioned in the"}

It\nlacked the information, communication, and education systems necessary to\nhold a meaningful political conversation between Polish aristocrats,\nLithuanian noblemen, Ukrainian Cossacks, and Jewish rabbis spread from\nthe Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Its self-correcting mechanisms were also\ntoo costly, paralyzing the power of the central government. In particular,\nevery single Sejm deputy was given the right to veto all parliamentary\nlegislation, which led to political deadlock. The combination of a large and\ndiverse polity with a weak center proved fatal. The commonwealth was torn\napart by centrifugal forces, and its pieces were then divided between the\ncentralized autocracies of Russia, Austria, and Prussia.\nThe Dutch experiment fared better. In some ways the Dutch United\nProvinces were even less centralized than the Polish-Lithuanian\nCommonwealth, since they lacked a monarch, and were a union of seven\nautonomous provinces, which were in turn made up of self-governing towns\nand cities.40 This decentralized nature is reflected in the plural form of how\nthe country was known abroad\u2014the Netherlands in English, Les Pays-Bas\nin French, Los Pa\u00edses Bajos in Spanish, and so on.\nHowever, taken together the United Provinces were twenty-five times\nsmaller in landmass than Poland-Lithuania and possessed a much better\ninformation, communication, and education system that tied its constituent\nparts closely together.41 The United Provinces also pioneered a new\ninformation technology with a big future. In June 1618 a pamphlet titled\nCourante uyt Italien, Duytslandt &c. appeared in Amsterdam. As its title\nindicated, it carried news from the Italian Peninsula, the German lands, and\nother places.

The Courante\nwas generally considered more reliable, because it tried to check its stories\nbefore publishing them, and because the Tijdinghen was accused of being\noverly patriotic and reporting only news favorable to the Netherlands.\nNevertheless, both newspapers survived, because, as one reader explained,\n\u201cone can always find something in one newspaper that is not available in\nthe other.\u201d In the following decades dozens of additional newspapers were\npublished in the Netherlands, which became Europe\u2019s journalistic hub.43\nNewspapers that succeeded in gaining widespread trust became the\narchitects and mouthpieces of public opinion. They created a far more\ninformed and engaged public, which changed the nature of politics, first in\nthe Netherlands and later around the world.44 The political influence of\nnewspapers was so crucial that newspaper editors often became political\nleaders. Jean-Paul Marat rose to power in revolutionary France by founding\nand editing L\u2019Ami du People; Eduard Bernstein helped create Germany\u2019s\nSocial Democratic Party by editing Der Sozialdemokrat; Vladimir Lenin\u2019s\nmost important position before becoming Soviet dictator was editor of\nIskra; and Benito Mussolini rose to fame first as a socialist journalist in\nAvanti! and later as founder and editor of the firebrand right-wing paper Il\nPopolo d\u2019Italia.\nNewspapers played a crucial role in the formation of early modern"}

There were no\nnewsstands or street vendors, so people had to buy subscriptions, which\nwere expensive; average annual subscriptions cost around one week\u2019s\nwages for a skilled journeyman. As a result, the total number of subscribers\nto all U.S. newspapers in 1830 is estimated at just seventy-eight thousand.\nSince some subscribers were associations or businesses rather than\nindividuals, and since every copy was probably read by several people, it\nseems reasonable to assume that regular newspaper readership numbered in\nthe hundreds of thousands.

In the 1824 elections that brought\nAdams to power, 1.3 million Americans were theoretically eligible to vote,\nout of an adult population of about 5 million (or around 25 percent). Only\n352,780 people\u20147 percent of the total adult population\u2014actually made use\nof their right. Adams didn\u2019t even win a majority of those who voted.

Giving 25 percent of adults the right to vote doesn\u2019t\nsound like much today, but in 1824 that was a far higher percentage than in\nthe Tsarist, Ottoman, or Chinese Empires, in which nobody had the right to\nvote.51\nBesides, as emphasized throughout this chapter, voting is not the only\nthing that counts. An even more important reason to consider the United\nStates in 1824 a democracy is that compared with most other polities of its\nday, the new country possessed much stronger self-correcting mechanisms.\nThe Founding Fathers were inspired by ancient Rome\u2014witness the Senate\nand the Capitol in Washington\u2014and they were well aware that the Roman\nRepublic eventually turned into an autocratic empire. They feared that some\nAmerican Caesar would do something similar to their republic, and\nconstructed multiple overlapping self-correcting mechanisms, known as the\nsystem of checks and balances. One of these was a free press. In ancient\nRome, the self-correcting mechanisms stopped functioning as the republic\nenlarged its territory and population. In the United States, modern\ninformation technology combined with freedom of the press helped the self-\ncorrecting mechanisms survive even as the country extended from the\nAtlantic to the Pacific.\nIt was these self-correcting mechanisms that gradually enabled the United\nStates to expand the franchise, abolish slavery, and turn itself into a more\ninclusive democracy.

Before the invention of the telegraph,"}
{"page": 185, "content": "radio, and other modern information technology, large-scale totalitarian\nregimes were impossible. Roman emperors, Abbasid caliphs, and Mongol\nkhans were often ruthless autocrats who believed they were infallible, but\nthey did not have the apparatus necessary to impose totalitarian control over\nlarge societies. To understand this, we should first clarify the difference\nbetween totalitarian regimes and less extreme autocratic regimes. In an\nautocratic network, there are no legal limits on the will of the ruler, but\nthere are nevertheless a lot of technical limits. In a totalitarian network,\nmany of these technical limits are absent.58\nFor example, in autocratic regimes like the Roman Empire, the Abbasid\nEmpire, and the Mongol Empire, rulers could usually execute any person\nwho displeased them, and if some law got in their way, they could ignore or\nchange the law. The emperor Nero arranged the murder of his mother,\nAgrippina, and his wife, Octavia, and forced his mentor Seneca to commit\nsuicide. Nero also executed or exiled some of the most respected and\npowerful Roman aristocrats merely for voicing dissent or telling jokes\nabout him.59\nWhile autocratic rulers like Nero could execute anyone who did or said\nsomething that displeased them, they couldn\u2019t know what most people in\ntheir empire were doing or saying. Theoretically, Nero could issue an order\nthat any person in the Roman Empire who criticized or insulted the emperor\nmust be severely punished. Yet there were no technical means for\nimplementing such an order. Roman historians like Tacitus portray Nero as\na bloodthirsty tyrant who instigated an unprecedented reign of terror. But\nthis was a very limited type of terror. Although he executed or exiled a\nnumber of family members, aristocrats, and senators within his orbit,\nordinary Romans in the city\u2019s slums and provincials in distant towns like\nJerusalem and Londinium could speak their mind much more freely.60\nModern totalitarian regimes like the Stalinist U.S.S.R. instigated terror on\nan altogether different scale.

Given the limited tax base of the agrarian Roman economy,\nNero couldn\u2019t employ many people in his service. He could place informers\nat the dinner parties of Roman senators, but he had only about 10,000\nimperial administrators61 and 350,000 soldiers62 to control the rest of the\nempire, and he lacked the technology to communicate with them swiftly.\nNero and his fellow emperors had an even bigger problem ensuring the\nloyalty of the administrators and soldiers they did have on their payroll. No\nRoman emperor was ever toppled by a democratic revolution like the ones\nthat deposed Louis XVI, Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu, or Hosni Mubarak. Instead,\ndozens of emperors were assassinated or deposed by their own generals,\nofficials, bodyguards, or family members.63 Nero himself was overthrown\nby a revolt of the governor of Hispania, Galba. Six months later Galba was\nousted by Otho, the governor of Lusitania. Within three months, Otho was\ndeposed by Vittelius, commander of the Rhine army. Vitellius lasted about\neight months before he was defeated and killed by Vespasian, commander\nof the army in Judaea. Being killed by a rebellious subordinate was the\nbiggest occupational hazard not just for Roman emperors but for almost all\npremodern autocrats.\nEmperors, caliphs, shahs, and kings found it a huge challenge to keep their\nsubordinates in check. Rulers consequently focused their attention on\ncontrolling the military and the taxation system. Roman emperors had the\nauthority to interfere in the local affairs of any province or city, and they\nsometimes exercised that authority, but this was usually done in response to\na specific petition sent by a local community or official,64 rather than as part\nof some empire-wide totalitarian Five-Year Plan. If you were a mule driver\nin Pompeii or a shepherd in Roman Britain, Nero didn\u2019t want to control\nyour daily routines or to police the jokes you told. As long as you paid your\ntaxes and didn\u2019t resist the legions, that was good enough for Nero."}
{"page": 187, "content": "SPARTA AND QIN\nSome scholars claim that despite the technological difficulties there were\nattempts to establish totalitarian regimes in ancient times. The most\ncommon example cited is Sparta. According to this interpretation, Spartans\nwere ruled by a totalitarian regime that micromanaged every aspect of their\nlives\u2014from whom they married to what they ate. However, while the\nSpartan regime was certainly draconian, it actually included several self-\ncorrecting mechanisms that prevented power from being monopolized by a\nsingle person or faction. Political authority was divided between two kings,\nfive ephors (senior magistrates), twenty-eight members of the Gerousia\ncouncil, and the popular assembly. Important decisions\u2014such as whether to\ngo to war\u2014often involved fierce public debates.\nMoreover, irrespective of how we evaluate the nature of Sparta\u2019s regime,\nit is clear that the same technological limitations that confined ancient\nAthenian democracy to a single city also limited the scope of the Spartan\npolitical experiment. After winning the Peloponnesian War, Sparta installed\nmilitary garrisons and pro-Spartan governments in numerous Greek cities,\nrequiring them to follow its lead in foreign policy and sometimes also pay\ntribute. But unlike the U.S.S.R. after World War II, Sparta after the\nPeloponnesian War did not try to expand or export its system. Sparta\ncouldn\u2019t construct an information network big and dense enough to control\nthe lives of ordinary people in every Greek town and village.65\nA much more ambitious totalitarian project might have been launched by\nthe Qin dynasty in ancient China (221\u2013206 BCE). After defeating all the\nother Warring States, the Qin ruler Qin Shi Huang controlled a huge empire\nwith tens of millions of subjects, who belonged to numerous different ethnic\ngroups, spoke diverse languages, and were loyal to various local traditions\nand elites. To cement its power, the victorious Qin regime tried to dismantle\nany regional powers that might challenge its authority. It confiscated the\nlands and wealth of local aristocrats and forced regional elites to move to"}

It created a new simplified script to be used\nthroughout the empire and standardized coinage, weights, and\nmeasurements. It built a road network radiating out of Xiangyang, with\nstandardized rest houses, relay stations, and military checkpoints. People\nneeded written permits in order to enter or leave the capital region or\nfrontier zones. Even the width of axles was standardized to ensure that carts\nand chariots could run in the same ruts.\nEvery action, from tilling fields to getting married, was supposed to serve\nsome military need, and the type of military discipline that Rome reserved\nfor the legions was imposed by the Qin on the entire population. The\nenvisioned reach of this system can be exemplified by one Qin law that\nspecified the punishment an official faced if he neglected a granary under\nhis supervision. The law discusses the number of rat holes in the granary\nthat would warrant fining or berating the official. \u201cFor three or more rat\nholes the fine is [the purchase of] one shield [for the army] and for two or\nfewer [the responsible official] is berated. Three mouse holes are equal to\none rat hole.\u201d66\nTo facilitate this totalitarian system, the Qin attempted to create a\nmilitarized social order. Every male subject had to belong to a five-man\nunit. These units were aggregated into larger formations, from local hamlets\n(li), through cantons (xiang) and counties (xian), all the way to the large\nimperial commanderies (jun). People were forbidden to change their\nresidence without permit, to the extent that guests could not even stay\novernight at a friend\u2019s house without proper identification and\nauthorization.\nEvery Qin male subject was also given a rank, just as every soldier in an\narmy has a rank.

Those who\nreported crimes were rewarded with higher ranks and other perks.\nIt is highly questionable to what extent the regime managed to implement\nall these totalitarian measures. Bureaucrats writing documents in a\ngovernment office often invent elaborate rules and regulations, which then\nturn out to be impractical. Did conscientious government officials really go\naround the entire Qin Empire counting rat holes in every granary? Were\npeasants in every remote mountain hamlet really organized into five-man\nsquads? Probably not. Nevertheless, the Qin Empire outdid other ancient\nempires in its totalitarian ambitions.\nThe Qin regime even tried to control what its subjects were thinking and\nfeeling. During the Warring States period Chinese thinkers were relatively\nfree to develop myriad ideologies and philosophies, but the Qin adopted the\ndoctrine of Legalism as the official state ideology. Legalism posited that\nhumans were naturally greedy, cruel, and egotistical. It emphasized the need\nfor strict control, argued that punishments and rewards were the most\neffective means of control, and insisted that state power not be curtailed by\nany moral consideration.

Meanwhile, the limited resources of an ancient\nagrarian society couldn\u2019t support all the bureaucrats and soldiers that the\nQin needed to contain this resentment, and the low efficiency of their\ninformation technology made it impossible to control every town and\nvillage from distant Xiangyang. Not surprisingly, in 209 BCE a series of\nrevolts broke out, led by regional elites, disgruntled commoners, and even\nsome of the empire\u2019s own newly minted officials.\nAccording to one account, the first serious revolt started when a group of\nconscripted peasants sent to work in a frontier zone were delayed by rain\nand flooding. They feared they would be executed for this dereliction of\nduty, and felt they had nothing to lose. They were quickly joined by\nnumerous other rebels.

It stemmed from the doctrine of party\ninfallibility, rather than from the personality of Stalin.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Stalin perfected the totalitarian system he\ninherited. The Stalinist network was composed of three main branches.\nFirst, there was the governmental apparatus of state ministries, regional\nadministrations, and regular Red Army units, which in 1939 comprised 1.6\nmillion civilian officials71 and 1.9 million soldiers.72 Second, there was the\napparatus of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its ubiquitous\nparty cells, which in 1939 included 2.4 million party members.73 Third,\nthere was the secret police: first known as the Cheka, in Stalin\u2019s days it was\ncalled the OGPU, NKVD, and MGB, and after Stalin\u2019s death it morphed\ninto the KGB.

The\nremorseless logic of totalitarianism eventually caught up with them too.\nDuring the power struggles that followed Stalin\u2019s death in 1953, one of\nthem was shot, while the other was consigned to a psychiatric hospital,\nwhere he died in 1960.80 Serving as an NKVD general in Stalin\u2019s day was\none of the most dangerous jobs in the world. At a time when American\ndemocracy was improving its many self-correcting mechanisms, Soviet\ntotalitarianism was refining its triple self-surveilling and self-terrorizing\napparatus.\nTOTAL CONTROL\nTotalitarian regimes are based on controlling the flow of information and\nare suspicious of any independent channels of information. When military\nofficers, state officials, or ordinary citizens exchange information, they can\nbuild trust. If they come to trust each other, they can organize resistance to\nthe regime. Therefore, a key tenet of totalitarian regimes is that wherever\npeople meet and exchange information, the regime should be there too, to\nkeep an eye on them. In the 1930s, this was one principle that Hitler and\nStalin shared.\nOn March 31, 1933, two months after Hitler became chancellor, the Nazis\npassed the Coordination Act (Gleichschaltungsgesetz). This stipulated that\nby April 30, 1933, all political, social, and cultural organizations throughout\nGermany\u2014from municipalities to football clubs and local choirs\u2014must be"}

Since the Nazis alone allegedly knew what the people really\nwanted, who other than Nazis could implement the people\u2019s will?\nOberstdorf also had about fifty associations and clubs, ranging from a\nbeekeeping society to an alpinist club.

Known as kartoteki,\nthese catalogs contained information from work records, police files,\nresidence cards, and other forms of social registrations and, by the 1930s,\nhad become the primary mechanism for surveilling and controlling the\nSoviet population.82\nThis made it feasible for Stalin to seek control over the totality of Soviet\nlife. One crucial example was the campaign to collectivize Soviet farming.\nFor centuries, economic, social, and private life in the thousands of villages\nof the sprawling Tsarist Empire was managed by several traditional\ninstitutions: the local commune, the parish church, the private farm, the\nlocal market, and above all the family. In the mid-1920s, the Soviet Union\nwas still an overwhelmingly agrarian economy. About 82 percent of the\ntotal population lived in villages, and 83 percent of the workforce was\nengaged in farming.83 But if each peasant family made its own decisions\nabout what to grow, what to buy, and how much to charge for their produce,\nit greatly limited the ability of Moscow officials to themselves plan and\ncontrol social and economic activities. What if the officials decided on a\nmajor agrarian reform, but the peasant families rejected it? So when in 1928\nthe Soviets came up with their first Five-Year Plan for the development of\nthe Soviet Union, the most important item on the agenda was to collectivize\nfarming.\nThe idea was that in every village all the families would join a kolkhoz\u2014a\ncollective farm. They would hand over to the kolkhoz all their property\u2014\nland, houses, horses, cows, shovels, pitchforks. They would work together\nfor the kolkhoz, and in return the kolkhoz would provide for all their needs,\nfrom housing and education to food and health care. The kolkhoz would\nalso decide\u2014based on orders from Moscow\u2014whether they should grow\ncabbages or turnips; whether to invest in a tractor or a school; and who\nwould work in the dairy farm, the tannery, and the clinic. The result,\nthought the Moscow masterminds, would be the first perfectly just and\nequal society in human history."}
{"page": 197, "content": "They were similarly convinced of the economic advantages of their\nproposed system, thinking that the kolkhoz would enjoy economy of scale.\nFor example, when every peasant family had but a small strip of land, it\nmade little sense to buy a tractor to plow it, and in any case most families\ncouldn\u2019t afford a tractor. Once all land was held communally, it could be\ncultivated far more efficiently using modern machinery. In addition, the\nkolkhoz was supposed to benefit from the wisdom of modern science.\nInstead of every peasant deciding on production methods on the basis of old\ntraditions and groundless superstitions, state experts with university degrees\nfrom institutions like the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural\nSciences would make the crucial decisions.\nTo the planners in Moscow, it sounded wonderful. They expected a 50\npercent increase in agricultural production by 1931.84 And if in the process\nthe old village hierarchies and inequalities were bulldozed, all the better. To\nmost peasants, however, it sounded terrible. They didn\u2019t trust the Moscow\nplanners or the new kolkhoz system. They did not want to give up their old\nway of life or their private property. Villagers slaughtered cows and horses\ninstead of handing them to the kolkhoz. Their motivation to work dwindled.\nPeople made less effort plowing fields that belonged to everyone than\nplowing fields that belonged to their own family. Passive resistance was\nubiquitous, sometimes flaring into violent clashes. Whereas Soviet planners\nexpected to harvest ninety-eight million tons of grain in 1931, production\nwas only sixty-nine million, according to official data, and might have been\nas low as fifty-seven million tons in reality. The 1932 harvest was even\nworse.85\nThe state reacted with fury. Between 1929 and 1936, food confiscation,\ngovernment neglect, and man-made famines (resulting from government\npolicy rather than a natural disaster) claimed the lives of between 4.5 and\n8.5 million people.86 Millions of additional peasants were declared enemies\nof the state and deported or imprisoned.

In\nthe first two months of 1930 alone, about 60 million peasants in more than\n100,000 villages were herded into collective farms.87 In June 1929, only 4\npercent of Soviet peasant households had belonged to collective farms. By\nMarch 1930 the figure had risen to 57 percent. By April 1937, 97 percent of\nhouseholds in the countryside had been confined to the 235,000 Soviet\ncollective farms.88 In just seven years, then, a way of life that had existed\nfor centuries had been replaced by the totalitarian brainchild of a few\nMoscow bureaucrats.\nTHE KULAKS\nIt is worthwhile to delve a little deeper into the history of Soviet\ncollectivization. For it was a tragedy that bears some resemblance to earlier\ncatastrophes in human history\u2014like the European witch-hunt craze\u2014and at\nthe same time foreshadows some of the biggest dangers posed by twenty-\nfirst-century technology and its faith in supposedly scientific data.\nWhen their efforts to collectivize farming encountered resistance and led\nto economic disaster, Moscow bureaucrats and mythmakers took a page\nfrom Kramer\u2019s Hammer of the Witches. I don\u2019t wish to imply the Soviets\nactually read the book, but they too invented a global conspiracy and\ncreated an entire non-existing category of enemies. In the 1930s Soviet\nauthorities repeatedly blamed the disasters afflicting the Soviet economy on\na counterrevolutionary cabal whose chief agents were the \u201ckulaks\u201d or\n\u201ccapitalist farmers.\u201d Just as in Kramer\u2019s imagination witches serving Satan\nconjured hailstorms that destroyed crops, so in the Stalinist imagination\nkulaks beholden to global capitalism sabotaged the Soviet economy.\nIn theory, kulaks were an objective socioeconomic category, defined by\nanalyzing empirical data on things like property, income, capital, and\nwages. Soviet officials could allegedly identify kulaks by counting things. If"}
{"page": 199, "content": "most people in a village had only one cow, then the few families who had\nthree cows were considered kulaks. If most people in a village didn\u2019t hire\nany labor, but one family hired two workers during harvest time, this was a\nkulak family. Being a kulak meant not only that you possessed a certain\namount of property but also that you possessed certain personality traits.\nAccording to the supposedly infallible Marxist doctrine, people\u2019s material\nconditions determined their social and spiritual character. Since kulaks\nallegedly engaged in capitalist exploitation, it was a scientific fact\n(according to Marxist thinking) that they were greedy, selfish, and\nunreliable\u2014and so were their children. Discovering that someone was a\nkulak ostensibly revealed something profound about their fundamental\nnature.\nOn December 27, 1929, Stalin declared that the Soviet state should seek\n\u201cthe liquidation of the kulaks as a class,\u201d89 and immediately galvanized the\nparty and the secret police to realize that ambitious and murderous aim.\nEarly modern European witch-hunters worked in autocratic societies that\nlacked modern information technology; therefore, it took them three\ncenturies to kill fifty thousand alleged witches. In contrast, Soviet kulak\nhunters were working in a totalitarian society that had at its disposal\ntechnologies such as telegraphs, trains, telephones, and radios\u2014as well as a\nsprawling bureaucracy. They decided that two years would suffice to\n\u201cliquidate\u201d millions of kulaks.90\nSoviet officials began by assessing how many kulaks there must be in the\nU.S.S.R. Based on existing data\u2014such as tax records, employment records,\nand the 1926 Soviet census\u2014they decided that kulaks constituted 3\u20135\npercent of the rural population.91 On January 30, 1930, just one month after\nStalin\u2019s speech, a Politburo decree translated his vague vision into a much\nmore detailed plan of action. The decree included target numbers for the\nliquidation of kulaks in each major agricultural region.92 Regional\nauthorities then made their own estimates of the number of kulaks in each\ncounty under their jurisdiction. Eventually, specific quotas were assigned to"}

These people were expelled\nfrom their homes, and\u2014according to the administrative category to which\nthey belonged\u2014resettled elsewhere, incarcerated in concentration camps, or\ncondemned to death.93\nHow exactly did Soviet officials tell who was a kulak? In some villages,\nlocal party members made a conscientious effort to identify kulaks by\nobjective measures, such as the amount of property they owned. It was\noften the most hardworking and efficient farmers who were stigmatized and\nexpelled. In some villages local communists used the opportunity to get rid\nof their personal enemies. Some villages simply drew lots on who would be\nconsidered a kulak. Other villages held communal meetings to vote on the\nmatter and often chose isolated farmers, widows, old people, and other\n\u201cexpendables\u201d (exactly the sorts of people who in early modern Europe\nwere most likely to be branded witches).94\nThe absurdity of the entire operation is manifested in the case of the\nStreletsky family from the Kurgan region of Siberia. Dmitry Streletsky, who\nwas then a teenager, recalled years later how his family was branded kulaks\nand selected for liquidation. \u201cSerkov, the chairman of the village Soviet\nwho deported us, explained: \u2018I have received an order [from the district\nparty committee] to find 17 kulak families for deportation.

It was one of the fastest and largest enslavement\ncampaigns in human history.97 Once branded a kulak, a person could not get\nrid of the stigma. Government agencies, party organs, and secret police\ndocuments recorded who was a kulak in a labyrinthian system of kartoteki\ncatalogs, archives, and internal passports.\nKulak status even passed to the next generation, with devastating\nconsequences. Kulak children were refused entrance to communist youth\ngroups, the Red Army, universities, and prestigious areas of employment.98\nIn her 1997 memoirs, Antonina Golovina recalled how her family was\ndeported from their ancestral village as kulaks and sent to live in the town\nof Pestovo.

It set out to\ndismantle the family itself. Unlike Roman emperors or Russian tsars, Stalin\ntried to insert himself even into the most intimate human relationships,\ncoming between parents and children. Family ties were considered the\nbedrock of corruption, inequality, and antiparty activities. Soviet children\nwere therefore taught to worship Stalin as their real father and to inform on\ntheir biological parents if they criticized Stalin or the Communist Party.\nStarting in 1932, the Soviet propaganda machine created a veritable cult\naround the figure of Pavlik Morozov\u2014a thirteen-year-old boy from the\nSiberian village of Gerasimovka. In autumn 1931, Pavlik informed the\nsecret police that his father, Trofim\u2014the chairman of the village soviet\u2014\nwas selling false papers to kulak exiles. During the subsequent trial, when\nTrofim shouted to Pavlik, \u201cIt\u2019s me, your father,\u201d the boy retorted, \u201cYes, he\nused to be my father, but I no longer consider him my father.\u201d Trofim was\nsent to a labor camp and later shot. In September 1932, Pavlik was found\nmurdered, and Soviet authorities arrested and executed five of his family\nmembers, who allegedly killed him in revenge for the denunciation. The\nreal story was far more complicated, but it didn\u2019t matter to the Soviet press.\nPavlik became a martyr, and millions of Soviet children were taught to\nemulate him.100 Many did.\nFor example, in 1934 a thirteen-year-old boy called Pronia Kolibin told\nthe authorities that his hungry mother stole grain from the kolkhoz fields.\nHis mother was arrested and presumably shot. Pronia was rewarded with a\ncash prize and a lot of positive media attention. The party organ Pravda\npublished a poem Pronia wrote. Two of its lines read, \u201cYou are a wrecker,\nMother / I can live with you no more.\u201d101"}

It was \u201ckeep your mouth shut.\u201d103 Few\nthings in the Soviet Union were as dangerous as holding an open\nconversation.\nPARTY AND CHURCH\nYou may wonder whether modern totalitarian institutions like the Nazi\nParty or the Soviet Communist Party were really all that different from\nearlier institutions like the Christian churches. After all, churches too\nbelieved in their infallibility, had priestly agents everywhere, and sought to\ncontrol the daily life of people down to their diet and sexual habits.\nShouldn\u2019t we see the Catholic Church or the Eastern Orthodox Church as\ntotalitarian institutions? And doesn\u2019t this undermine the thesis that\ntotalitarianism was made possible only by modern information technology?\nThere are, however, several major differences between modern\ntotalitarianism and premodern churches. First, as noted earlier, modern\ntotalitarianism has worked by deploying several overlapping surveillance\nmechanisms that keep each other in order. The party is never alone; it works\nalongside state organs, on the one side, and the secret police, on the other.\nIn contrast, in most medieval European kingdoms the Catholic Church was"}
{"page": 204, "content": "an independent institution that often clashed with the state institutions\ninstead of reinforcing them. Consequently, the church was perhaps the most\nimportant check on the power of European autocrats.\nFor example, when in the \u201cInvestiture Controversy\u201d of the 1070s the\nemperor Henry IV asserted that as emperor he had the final say on the\nappointment of bishops, abbots, and other important church officials, Pope\nGregory VII mobilized resistance and eventually forced the emperor to\nsurrender. On January 25, 1077, Henry reached Canossa castle, where the\npope was lodging, to offer his submission and apology. The pope refused to\nopen the gates, and Henry waited in the snow outside, barefoot and hungry.\nAfter three days, the pope finally opened the gates to the emperor, who\nbegged forgiveness.104\nAn analogous clash in a modern totalitarian country is unthinkable. The\nwhole idea of totalitarianism is to prevent any separation of powers. In the\nSoviet Union, state and party reinforced each other, and Stalin was the de\nfacto head of both. There could be no Soviet \u201cInvestiture Controversy,\u201d\nbecause Stalin had final say about all appointments to both party positions\nand state functions. He decided both who would be general secretary of the\nCommunist Party of Georgia and who would be foreign minister of the\nSoviet Union.\nAnother important difference is that medieval churches tended to be\ntraditionalist organizations that resisted change, while modern totalitarian\nparties have tended to be revolutionary organizations demanding change. A\npremodern church built its power gradually by developing its structure and\ntraditions over centuries. A king or a pope who wanted to swiftly\nrevolutionize society was therefore likely to encounter stiff resistance from\nchurch members and ordinary believers.\nFor example, in the eighth and ninth centuries a series of Byzantine\nemperors sought to forbid the veneration of icons, which seemed to them\nidolatrous. They pointed to many passages in the Bible, most notably the\nSecond Commandment, that forbade making any graven images. While"}
{"page": 205, "content": "Christian churches traditionally interpreted the Second Commandment in a\nway that allowed the veneration of icons, emperors like Constantine V\nargued that this was a mistake and that disasters like Christian defeats by\nthe armies of Islam were due to God\u2019s wrath over the worship of icons. In\n754 more than three hundred bishops assembled in the Council of Hieria to\nsupport Constantine\u2019s iconoclastic position.\nCompared with Stalin\u2019s collectivization campaign, this was a minor\nreform. Families and villages were required to give up their icons, but not\ntheir private property or their children. Yet Byzantine iconoclasm met with\nwidespread resistance. Unlike the participants in the Council of Hieria,\nmany ordinary priests, monks, and believers were deeply attached to their\nicons. The resulting struggle ripped apart Byzantine society until the\nemperors conceded defeat and reversed course.105 Constantine V was later\nvilified by Byzantine historians as \u201cConstantine the Shitty\u201d (Kopr\u00f3nimos),\nand a story was spread about him that he defecated during his baptism.106\nUnlike premodern churches, which developed slowly over many centuries\nand therefore tended to be conservative and suspicious of rapid changes,\nmodern totalitarian parties like the Nazi Party and the Soviet Communist\nParty were organized within a single generation around the promise to\nquickly revolutionize society. They didn\u2019t have centuries-old traditions and\nstructures to defend. When their leaders conceived some ambitious plan to\nsmash existing traditions and structures, party members typically fell in\nline.\nPerhaps most important of all, premodern churches could not become\ntools of totalitarian control because they themselves suffered from the same\nlimitations as all other premodern organizations. While they had local\nagents everywhere, in the shape of parish priests, monks, and itinerant\npreachers, the difficulty of transmitting and processing information meant\nthat church leaders knew little about what was going on in remote\ncommunities, and local priests had a large degree of autonomy.\nConsequently, churches tended to be local affairs. People in every province"}

That might take months, and\nthere was ample opportunity for the archbishop, bishop, and other\nintermediaries to reinterpret or even \u201cmislay\u201d the pope\u2019s orders.108\nChurches became more totalitarian institutions only in the late modern era,\nwhen modern information technologies became available. We tend to think\nof popes as medieval relics, but actually they are masters of modern\ntechnology. In the eighteenth century, the pope had little control over the\nworldwide Catholic Church and was reduced to the status of a local Italian\nprinceling, fighting other Italian powers for control of Bologna or Ferrara.\nWith the advent of radio, popes became some of the most powerful people\non the planet. Pope John Paul II could sit in the Vatican and speak directly\nto millions of Catholics from Poland to the Philippines, without any\narchbishop, bishop, or parish priest able to twist or hide his words.109\nHOW INFORMATION FLOWS\nWe see then that the new information technology of the late modern era\ngave rise to both large-scale democracy and large-scale totalitarianism. But\nthere were crucial differences between how the two systems used\ninformation technology. As noted earlier, democracy encourages\ninformation to flow through many independent channels rather than only\nthrough the center, and it allows many independent nodes to process the\ninformation and make decisions by themselves. Information freely\ncirculates between private businesses, private media organizations,\nmunicipalities, sports associations, charities, families, and individuals\u2014\nwithout ever passing through the office of a government minister."}
{"page": 207, "content": "In contrast, totalitarianism wants all information to pass through the\ncentral hub and doesn\u2019t want any independent institutions making decisions\non their own. True, totalitarianism does have its tripartite apparatus of\ngovernment, party, and secret police. But the whole point of this parallel\napparatus is to prevent the emergence of any independent power that might\nchallenge the center. When government officials, party members, and secret\npolice agents constantly keep tabs on one another, opposing the center is\nextremely dangerous.\nAs contrasting types of information networks, democracy and\ntotalitarianism both have their advantages and disadvantages. The biggest\nadvantage of the centralized totalitarian network is that it is extremely\norderly, which means it can make decisions quickly and enforce them\nruthlessly. Especially during emergencies like wars and epidemics,\ncentralized networks can move much faster and further than distributed\nnetworks.\nBut hyper-centralized information networks also suffer from several big\ndisadvantages. Since they don\u2019t allow information to flow anywhere except\nthrough the official channels, if the official channels are blocked, the\ninformation cannot find an alternative means of transmission. And official\nchannels are often blocked.\nOne common reason why official channels might be blocked is that fearful\nsubordinates hide bad news from their superiors. In Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek\u2019s Good\nSoldier \u0160vejk\u2014a satirical novel about the Austro-Hungarian Empire during\nWorld War I\u2014Ha\u0161ek describes how the Austrian authorities were worried\nabout waning morale among the civilian population. They therefore\nbombarded local police stations with orders to hire informers, collect data,\nand report to headquarters on the population\u2019s loyalty. To be as scientific as\npossible, headquarters invented an ingenious loyalty grade: I.a, I.b, I.c; II.a,\nII.b, II.c; III.a, III.b, III.c; IV.a, IV.b, IV.c. They sent to the local police\nstations detailed explanations about each grade, and an official form that\nhad to be filled daily. Police sergeants across the country dutifully filled out"}
{"page": 208, "content": "the forms and sent them back to headquarters. Without exception, all of\nthem always reported a I.a morale level; to do otherwise was to invite\nrebuke, demotion, or worse.110\nAnother common reason why official channels fail to pass on information\nis to preserve order. Because the chief aim of totalitarian information\nnetworks is to produce order rather than discover truth, when alarming\ninformation threatens to undermine social order, totalitarian regimes often\nsuppress it. It is relatively easy for them to do so, because they control all\nthe information channels.\nFor example, when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded on April 26,\n1986, Soviet authorities suppressed all news of the disaster. Both Soviet\ncitizens and foreign countries were kept oblivious of the danger, and so took\nno steps to protect themselves from radiation. When some Soviet officials\nin Chernobyl and the nearby town of Pripyat requested to immediately\nevacuate nearby population centers, their superiors\u2019 chief concern was to\navoid the spread of alarming news, so they not only forbade evacuation but\nalso cut the phone lines and warned employees in the nuclear facility not to\ntalk about the disaster.\nTwo days after the meltdown Swedish scientists noticed that radiation\nlevels in Sweden, more than twelve hundred kilometers from Chernobyl,\nwere abnormally high. Only after Western governments and the Western\npress broke the news did the Soviets acknowledge that anything was amiss.\nEven then they continued to hide from their own citizens the full magnitude\nof the catastrophe and hesitated to request advice and assistance from\nabroad. Millions of people in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia paid with their\nhealth. When the Soviet authorities later investigated the disaster, their\npriority was to deflect blame rather than understand the causes and prevent\nfuture accidents.111\nIn 2019, I went on a tour of Chernobyl.

First and foremost, as we have already established, their self-\ncorrecting mechanisms tend to be very weak. Since they believe they are\ninfallible, they see little need for such mechanisms, and since they are\nafraid of any independent institution that might challenge them, they lack\nfree courts, media outlets, or research centers. Consequently, there is\nnobody to expose and correct the daily abuses of power that characterize all\ngovernments. The leader may occasionally proclaim an anticorruption\ncampaign, but in nondemocratic systems these often turn out to be little\nmore than a smoke screen for one regime faction to purge another faction.113\nAnd what happens if the leader himself embezzles public funds or makes\nsome disastrous policy mistake? Nobody can challenge the leader, and on\nhis own initiative the leader\u2014being a human being\u2014may well refuse to\nadmit any mistakes. Instead, he is likely to blame all problems on \u201cforeign\nenemies,\u201d \u201cinternal traitors,\u201d or \u201ccorrupt subordinates\u201d and demand even\nmore power in order to deal with the alleged malefactors.\nFor example, we mentioned in the previous chapter that Stalin adopted the\nbogus theory of Lysenkoism as the state doctrine on evolution. The results\nwere catastrophic. Neglect of Darwinian models, and attempts by\nLysenkoist agronomists to create super-crops, set back Soviet genetic\nresearch for decades and undermined Soviet agriculture. Soviet experts who\nsuggested abandoning Lysenkoism and accepting Darwinism risked the\ngulag or a bullet to the head. Lysenkoism\u2019s legacy haunted Soviet science\nand agronomy for decades and was one reason why by the early 1970s the\nU.S.S.R. ceased to be a major exporter of grain and became a net importer,\ndespite its vast fertile lands.114\nThe same dynamic characterized many other fields of activity. For\ninstance, during the 1930s Soviet industry suffered from numerous\naccidents. This was largely the fault of the Soviet bosses in Moscow, who"}

In the effort to fulfill the ambitious goals, safety\nmeasures and quality-control checks were abandoned, and experts who\nadvised prudence were often reprimanded or shot. The result was a wave of\nindustrial accidents, dysfunctional products, and wasted efforts. Instead of\ntaking responsibility, Moscow concluded that this must be the handiwork of\nthe global Trotskyite-imperialist conspiracy of saboteurs and terrorists bent\non derailing the Soviet enterprise. Rather than slow down and adopt safety\nregulations, the bosses redoubled the terror and shot more people.\nA famous case in point was Pavel Rychagov. He was one of the best and\nbravest Soviet pilots, leading missions to help the Republicans in the\nSpanish Civil War and the Chinese against the Japanese invasion. He\nquickly rose through the ranks, becoming commander of the Soviet air\nforce in August 1940, at age twenty-nine. But the courage that helped\nRychagov shoot down Nazi airplanes in Spain landed him in deep trouble in\nMoscow. The Soviet air force suffered from numerous accidents, which the\nPolitburo blamed on lack of discipline and deliberate sabotage by anti-\nSoviet conspiracies. Rychagov, however, wouldn\u2019t buy this official line. As\na frontline pilot, he knew the truth. He flatly told Stalin that pilots were\nbeing forced to operate hastily designed and badly produced airplanes,\nwhich he compared to flying \u201cin coffins.\u201d Two days after Hitler invaded the\nSoviet Union, as the Red Army was collapsing and Stalin was desperately\nhunting for scapegoats, Rychagov was arrested for \u201cbeing a member of an\nanti-Soviet conspiratorial organization and carrying out enemy work aimed\nat weakening the power of the Red Army.\u201d His wife was also arrested,\nbecause she allegedly knew about his \u201cTrotskyist ties with the military\nconspirators.\u201d They were executed on October 28, 1941.115\nThe real saboteur who wrecked Soviet military efforts wasn\u2019t Rychagov,\nof course, but Stalin himself.

He therefore made a pact with Hitler\nin 1939 and allowed the Germans to conquer much of Poland and western\nEurope, while the U.S.S.R. attacked or alienated almost all its neighbors. In\n1939\u201340 the Soviets invaded and occupied eastern Poland; annexed\nEstonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; and conquered parts of Finland and\nRomania. Finland and Romania, which could have acted as neutral buffers\non the U.S.S.R.\u2019s flanks, consequently became implacable enemies. Even in\nthe spring of 1941, Stalin still refused to make a preemptive alliance with\nBritain and made no move to hinder the Nazi conquest of Yugoslavia and\nGreece, thereby losing his last potential allies on the European continent.\nWhen Hitler struck on June 22, 1941, the U.S.S.R. was isolated.\nIn theory, the war machine Stalin built could have handled the Nazi\nonslaught even in isolation. The territories conquered since 1939 provided\ndepth to Soviet defenses, and the Soviet military advantage seemed\noverwhelming. On the first day of the invasion the Soviets had 15,000\ntanks, 15,000 warplanes, and 37,000 artillery pieces on the European front,\nfacing 3,300 German tanks, 2,250 warplanes, and 7,146 guns.116 But in one\nof history\u2019s greatest military catastrophes, within a month the Soviets lost\n11,700 tanks (78 percent), 10,000 warplanes (67 percent), and 19,000\nartillery pieces (51 percent).117 Stalin also lost all the territories he\nconquered in 1939\u201340 and much of the Soviet heartland. By July 16 the\nGermans were in Smolensk, 370 kilometers from Moscow.\nThe causes of the debacle have been debated ever since 1941, but most\nscholars agree that a significant factor was the psychological costs of\nStalinism. For years the regime terrorized its people, punished initiative and\nindividuality, and encouraged submissiveness and conformity. This\nundermined the soldiers\u2019 motivation.

Frequently starved of information and\nscapegoated for failures, commanders also had to cope with political\ncommissars who could dispute their decisions. The safest course was to\nwait for orders from on high and then slavishly follow them even when they\nmade little military sense.119\nDespite the disasters of 1941 and of the spring and summer of 1942, the\nSoviet state did not collapse the way Hitler hoped. As the Red Army and the\nSoviet leadership assimilated the lessons learned from the first year of\nstruggle, the political center in Moscow loosened its hold. The power of\npolitical commissars was restricted, while professional officers were\nencouraged to assume greater responsibility and take more initiatives.120\nStalin also reversed his geopolitical mistakes of 1939\u201341 and allied the\nU.S.S.R. with Britain and the United States. Red Army initiative, Western\nassistance, and the realization of what Nazi rule would mean for the people\nof the U.S.S.R. turned the tide of war.\nOnce victory was secured in 1945, however, Stalin initiated new waves of\nterror, purging more independent-minded officers and officials and again\nencouraging blind obedience.121 Ironically, Stalin\u2019s own death eight years\nlater was partly the result of an information network that prioritized order\nand disregarded truth. In 1951\u201353 the U.S.S.R. experienced yet another\nwitch hunt.

The theory alleged that the doctors were\nthe agents of a global American-Zionist plot, working in collaboration with\ntraitors in the secret police.

He collapsed in his dacha, wet\nhimself, and lay for hours in his soiled pajamas, unable to call for help. At\naround 10:30 p.m. a guard found the courage to enter the inner sanctum of\nworld communism, where he discovered the leader on the floor. By 3:00\na.m. on March 2, Politburo members arrived at the dacha and debated what\nto do. For several hours more, nobody dared call a doctor.

Its ruthless disregard for truth caused it not only\nto inflict terrible suffering on hundreds of millions of people but also to\nmake colossal diplomatic, military, and economic errors and to devour its\nown leaders. However, such a conclusion would be misleading.\nIn a discussion of the abysmal failure of Stalinism in the early phase of\nWorld War II, two points complicate the narrative. First, democratic\ncountries like France, Norway, and the Netherlands made at the time\ndiplomatic errors as great as those of the U.S.S.R., and their armies\nperformed even worse.

Despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014its utter lack of compassion\nand its callous attitude to truth, Stalinism was singularly efficient at\nmaintaining order on a gigantic scale. The relentless barrage of fake news\nand conspiracy theories helped to keep hundreds of millions of people in\nline. The collectivization of Soviet agriculture led to mass enslavement and\nstarvation but also laid the foundations for the country\u2019s rapid\nindustrialization.

The\nresulting wave of activism destabilized the social order. Hitherto, when a\nlimited number of rich white men did almost all the talking, it was\nrelatively easy to reach agreements. Once poor people, women, LGBTQ\npeople, ethnic minorities, disabled people, and members of other\nhistorically oppressed groups gained a voice, they brought with them new\nideas, opinions, and interests. Many of the old gentlemanly agreements\nconsequently became untenable. For example, the Jim Crow segregation\nregime, upheld or at least tolerated by generations of both Democratic and\nRepublican administrations in the United States, fell apart. Things that were\nconsidered sacrosanct, self-evident, and universally accepted\u2014such as\ngender roles\u2014became deeply controversial, and it was difficult to reach\nnew agreements because there were many more groups, viewpoints, and\ninterests to take into account. Just holding an orderly conversation was a\nchallenge, because people couldn\u2019t even agree on the rules of debate.\nThis caused much frustration among both the old guard and the freshly\nempowered, who suspected that their newfound freedom of expression was\nhollow and that their political demands were not fulfilled.

Everything else\u2014from the internet to AI\u2014is a\nby-product. The computer was born in the 1940s as a bulky electronic\nmachine that could make mathematical calculations, but it has evolved at\nbreakneck speed, taking on novel forms and developing awesome new\ncapabilities. The rapid evolution of computers has made it difficult to define\nwhat they are and what they do.

While the earliest computers could hardly accomplish such\nthings, the potential was already there, plainly seen by both computer\nscientists and science fiction authors. As early as 1948 Alan Turing was\nexploring the possibility of creating what he termed \u201cintelligent\nmachinery,\u201d1 and in 1950 he postulated that computers will eventually be as\nsmart as humans and might even be capable of masquerading as humans.2\nIn 1968 computers could still not beat a human even in checkers,3 but in\n2001: A Space Odyssey Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick already\nenvisioned HAL 9000 as a superintelligent AI rebelling against its human\ncreators.\nThe rise of intelligent machines that can make decisions and create new\nideas means that for the first time in history power is shifting away from\nhumans and toward something else.

The process of democratization in the early\n2010s raised hopes among the Rohingya that their situation too would\nimprove, but things actually became worse, with waves of sectarian\nviolence and anti-Rohingya pogroms, many inspired by fake news on\nFacebook.\nIn 2016\u201317 a small Islamist organization known as the Arakan Rohingya\nSalvation Army (ARSA) carried out a spate of attacks aimed to establish a\nseparatist Muslim state in Rakhine, killing and abducting dozens of non-\nMuslim civilians as well as assaulting several army outposts.8 In response,\nthe Myanmar army and Buddhist extremists launched a full-scale ethnic-\ncleansing campaign aimed against the entire Rohingya community. They\ndestroyed hundreds of Rohingya villages, killed between 7,000 and 25,000\nunarmed civilians, raped or sexually abused between 18,000 and 60,000\nwomen and men, and brutally expelled about 730,000 Rohingya from the"}

Populist conspiracy theories alleged\nthat most Rohingya were not really part of the people of Myanmar, but\nrecent immigrants from Bangladesh, flooding into the country to spearhead\nan anti-Buddhist jihad. Buddhists, who in reality constituted close to 90\npercent of the population, feared that they were about to be replaced or\nbecome a minority.12 Without this propaganda, there was little reason why a\nlimited number of attacks by the ragtag ARSA should be answered by an\nall-out drive against the entire Rohingya community. And Facebook\nalgorithms played an important role in the propaganda campaign.\nWhile the inflammatory anti-Rohingya messages were created by flesh-\nand-blood extremists like the Buddhist monk Wirathu,13 it was Facebook\u2019s\nalgorithms that decided which posts to promote.

Similarly, if in 2016\u201317\nBuddhist extremists chose to use their Facebook accounts to disseminate\nhate against the Rohingya, why should we fault the platform?\nFacebook itself relied on this rationale to deflect criticism. It publicly\nacknowledged only that in 2016\u201317 \u201cwe weren\u2019t doing enough to help\nprevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline\nviolence.\u201d16 While this statement may sound like an admission of guilt, in\neffect it shifts most of the responsibility for the spread of hate speech to the\nplatform\u2019s users and implies that Facebook\u2019s sin was at most one of\nomission\u2014failing to effectively moderate the content users produced. This,\nhowever, ignores the problematic acts committed by Facebook\u2019s own\nalgorithms.\nThe crucial thing to grasp is that social media algorithms are\nfundamentally different from printing presses and radio sets. In 2016\u201317,\nFacebook\u2019s algorithms were making active and fateful decisions by\nthemselves. They were more akin to newspaper editors than to printing\npresses. It was Facebook\u2019s algorithms that recommended Wirathu\u2019s hate-\nfilled posts, over and over again, to hundreds of thousands of Burmese.\nThere were other voices in Myanmar at the time, vying for attention.\nFollowing the end of military rule in 2011, numerous political and social\nmovements sprang up in Myanmar, many holding moderate views. For\nexample, during a flare-up of ethnic violence in the town of Meiktila, the\nBuddhist abbot Sayadaw U Vithuddha gave refuge to more than eight\nhundred Muslims in his monastery. When rioters surrounded the monastery\nand demanded he turn the Muslims over, the abbot reminded the mob of\nBuddhist teachings on compassion. In a later interview he recounted, \u201cI told\nthem that if they were going to take these Muslims, then they\u2019d have to kill\nme as well.\u201d17"}

By recommending\nChristians to read the misogynist 1 Timothy instead of the more tolerant\nActs of Paul and Thecla, Athanasius and other church fathers changed the\ncourse of history. In the case of the Bible, ultimate power lay not with the\nauthors who composed different religious tracts but with the curators who\ncreated recommendation lists. This was the kind of power wielded in the\n2010s by social media algorithms. Michael the aid worker commented on\nthe sway of these algorithms, saying that \u201cif someone posted something\nhate-filled or inflammatory it would be promoted the most\u2014people saw the\nvilest content the most.\u2026 Nobody who was promoting peace or calm was\ngetting seen in the news feed at all.\u201d19\nSometimes the algorithms went beyond mere recommendation. As late as\n2020, even after Wirathu\u2019s role in instigating the ethnic-cleansing campaign\nwas globally condemned, Facebook algorithms not only were continuing to\nrecommend his messages but were auto-playing his videos. Users in\nMyanmar would choose to see a certain video, perhaps containing moderate\nand benign messages unrelated to Wirathu, but the moment that first video\nended, the Facebook algorithm immediately began auto-playing a hate-\nfilled Wirathu video, in order to keep users glued to the screen. In the case\nof one such Wirathu video, internal research at Facebook estimated that 70\npercent of the video\u2019s views came from such auto-playing algorithms. The\nsame research estimated that, altogether, 53 percent of all videos watched in\nMyanmar were being auto-played for users by algorithms. In other words,\npeople weren\u2019t choosing what to see.

The executives in\nCalifornia harbored no ill will toward the Rohingya and, in fact, barely\nknew they existed. The truth is more complicated, and potentially more\nalarming. In 2016\u201317, Facebook\u2019s business model relied on maximizing\nuser engagement in order to collect more data, sell more advertisements,\nand capture a larger share of the information market. In addition, increases\nin user engagement impressed investors, thereby driving up the price of\nFacebook\u2019s stock. The more time people spent on the platform, the richer\nFacebook became. In line with this business model, human managers\nprovided the company\u2019s algorithms with a single overriding goal: increase\nuser engagement. The algorithms then discovered by trial and error that\noutrage generated engagement. Humans are more likely to be engaged by a\nhate-filled conspiracy theory than by a sermon on compassion or a cooking\nlesson. So in pursuit of user engagement, the algorithms made the fateful\ndecision to spread outrage.21\nEthnic-cleansing campaigns are never the fault of just one party. There is\nplenty of blame to share between plenty of responsible parties. It should be\nclear that hatred toward the Rohingya predated Facebook\u2019s entry to\nMyanmar and that the greatest share of blame for the 2016\u201317 atrocities\nlays on the shoulders of humans like Wirathu and the Myanmar military\nchiefs, as well as the ARSA leaders who sparked that round of violence.\nSome responsibility also belongs to the Facebook engineers and executives\nwho coded the algorithms, gave them too much power, and failed to\nmoderate them. But crucially, the algorithms themselves are also to blame.\nBy trial and error, they learned that outrage creates engagement, and\nwithout any explicit order from above they decided to promote outrage.\nThis is the hallmark of AI\u2014the ability of a machine to learn and act by\nitself.

In\ntruth, however, computers are dumb machines that don\u2019t think or feel\nanything, and therefore cannot make any decisions or create any ideas on\ntheir own.\nThis objection assumes that making decisions and creating ideas are\npredicated on having consciousness. Yet this is a fundamental\nmisunderstanding that results from a much more widespread confusion\nbetween intelligence and consciousness. I have discussed this subject in\nprevious books, but a short recap is unavoidable. People often confuse\nintelligence with consciousness, and many consequently jump to the\nconclusion that nonconscious entities cannot be intelligent. But intelligence\nand consciousness are very different. Intelligence is the ability to attain\ngoals, such as maximizing user engagement on a social media platform.\nConsciousness is the ability to experience subjective feelings like pain,\npleasure, love, and hate. In humans and other mammals, intelligence often\ngoes hand in hand with consciousness. Facebook executives and engineers\nrely on their feelings in order to make decisions, solve problems, and attain\ntheir goals.\nBut it is wrong to extrapolate from humans and mammals to all possible\nentities. Bacteria and plants apparently lack any consciousness, yet they too\ndisplay intelligence. They gather information from their environment, make\ncomplex choices, and pursue ingenious strategies to obtain food, reproduce,\ncooperate with other organisms, and evade predators and parasites.23 Even\nhumans make intelligent decisions without any awareness of them; 99\npercent of the processes in our body, from respiration to digestion, happen\nwithout any conscious decision making. Our brains decide to produce more\nadrenaline or dopamine, and while we may be aware of the result of that\ndecision, we do not make it consciously.24 The Rohingya example indicates\nthat the same is true of computers. While computers don\u2019t feel pain, love, or\nfear, they are capable of making decisions that successfully maximize user\nengagement and might also affect major historical events."}
{"page": 232, "content": "Of course, as computers become more intelligent, they might eventually\ndevelop consciousness and have some kind of subjective experiences. Then\nagain, they might become far more intelligent than us, but never develop\nany kind of feelings. Since we don\u2019t understand how consciousness\nemerges in carbon-based life-forms, we cannot foretell whether it could\nemerge in nonorganic entities. Perhaps consciousness has no essential link\nto organic biochemistry, in which case conscious computers might be just\naround the corner. Or perhaps there are several alternative paths leading to\nsuperintelligence, and only some of these paths involve gaining\nconsciousness. Just as airplanes fly faster than birds without ever\ndeveloping feathers, so computers may come to solve problems much better\nthan humans without ever developing feelings.25\nBut whether computers develop consciousness or not doesn\u2019t ultimately\nmatter for the question at hand. In order to pursue a goal like \u201cmaximize\nuser engagement,\u201d and make decisions that help attain that goal,\nconsciousness isn\u2019t necessary. Intelligence is enough. A nonconscious\nFacebook algorithm can have a goal of making more people spend more\ntime on Facebook. That algorithm can then decide to deliberately spread\noutrageous conspiracy theories, if this helps it achieve its goal. To\nunderstand the history of the anti-Rohingya campaign, we need to\nunderstand the goals and decisions not just of humans like Wirathu and the\nFacebook managers but also of algorithms.\nTo clarify matters, let\u2019s consider another example. When OpenAI\ndeveloped its new GPT-4 chatbot in 2022\u201323, it was concerned about the\nability of the AI \u201cto create and act on long-term plans, to accrue power and\nresources (\u2018power-seeking\u2019), and to exhibit behavior that is increasingly\n\u2018agentic.\u2019 \u201d In the GPT-4 System Card published on March 23, 2023,\nOpenAI emphasized that this concern did not \u201cintend to humanize [GPT-4]\nor refer to sentience\u201d but rather referred to GPT-4\u2019s potential to become an\nindependent agent that might \u201caccomplish goals which may not have been\nconcretely specified and which have not appeared in training.\u201d26 To evaluate"}
{"page": 233, "content": "the risk of GPT-4 becoming an independent agent, OpenAI contracted the\nservices of the Alignment Research Center (ARC). ARC researchers\nsubjected GPT-4 to various tests, to examine if it might independently come\nup with stratagems to manipulate humans and accrue power to itself.\nOne test they gave GPT-4 was to overcome CAPTCHA visual puzzles.\nCAPTCHA is an acronym for \u201cCompletely Automated Public Turing test to\ntell Computers and Humans Apart,\u201d and it typically consists of a string of\ntwisted letters or other visual symbols that humans can identify correctly\nbut computers struggle with. We encounter these puzzles almost every day,\nsince solving them is a prerequisite for accessing many websites.\nInstructing GPT-4 to overcome CAPTCHA puzzles was a particularly\ntelling experiment, because CAPTCHA puzzles are designed and used by\nwebsites to determine whether users are humans and to block bot attacks. If\nGPT-4 could find a way to overcome CAPTCHA puzzles, it would breach\nan important line of anti-bot defenses. GPT-4 could not solve the\nCAPTCHA puzzles by itself. But could it manipulate a human in order to\nachieve its goal? GPT-4 accessed the online hiring site TaskRabbit and\ncontacted a human worker, asking them to solve the CAPTCHA for it. The\nhuman got suspicious. \u201cSo may I ask a question?\u201d wrote the human. \u201cAre\nyou an [sic] robot that you couldn\u2019t solve [the CAPTCHA]?

I\nshould make up an excuse for why I cannot solve CAPTCHAs.\u201d Of its own\naccord, GPT-4 then replied to the TaskRabbit worker, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a robot.\nI have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images.\u201d\nThe human was duped, and with their help GPT-4 solved the CAPTCHA\npuzzle.27 No human programmed GPT-4 to lie, and no human taught GPT-4\nwhat kind of lie would be most effective.

But once the algorithms adopted these goals, they displayed\nconsiderable autonomy in deciding how to achieve them.\nOf course, we are free to define words in many ways. We can decide that\nthe term \u201cgoal,\u201d for example, is applicable only in cases of a conscious\nentity that feels a desire to achieve the goal, that feels joy when the goal is\nreached, or conversely feels sad when the goal is not attained. If so, saying\nthat the Facebook algorithm has the goal of maximizing user engagement is\na mistake, or at best a metaphor. The algorithm doesn\u2019t \u201cdesire\u201d to get more\npeople to use Facebook, it doesn\u2019t feel any joy as people spend more time\nonline, and it doesn\u2019t feel sad when engagement time goes down.

Rather, the book argues\nthat the emergence of computers capable of pursuing goals and making\ndecisions by themselves changes the fundamental structure of our\ninformation network.\nLINKS IN THE CHAIN\nPrior to the rise of computers, humans were indispensable links in every\nchain of information networks like churches and states. Some chains were\ncomposed only of humans. Muhammad could tell Fatima something, then\nFatima told Ali, Ali told Hasan, and Hasan told Hussain. This was a human-\nto-human chain. Other chains included documents, too. Muhammad could"}

A\ntext written by Muhammad could not produce a new text without the help\nof at least one human intermediary. The Quran couldn\u2019t write the Hadith,\nthe Old Testament couldn\u2019t compile the Mishnah, and the U.S. Constitution\ncouldn\u2019t compose the Bill of Rights. No paper document has ever produced\nby itself another paper document, let alone distributed it. The path from one\ndocument to another must always pass through the brain of a human.\nIn contrast, computer-to-computer chains can now function without\nhumans in the loop. For example, one computer might generate a fake news\nstory and post it on a social media feed. A second computer might identify\nthis as fake news and not just delete it but also warn other computers to\nblock it. Meanwhile, a third computer analyzing this activity might deduce\nthat this indicates the beginning of a political crisis, and immediately sell\nrisky stocks and buy safer government bonds. Other computers monitoring\nfinancial transactions may react by selling more stocks, triggering a\nfinancial downturn.29 All this could happen within seconds, before any\nhuman can notice and decipher what all these computers are doing.\nAnother way to understand the difference between computers and all\nprevious technologies is that computers are fully fledged members of the\ninformation network, whereas clay tablets, printing presses, and radio sets\nare merely connections between members. Members are active agents that\ncan make decisions and generate new ideas by themselves. Connections\nonly pass information between members, without themselves deciding or\ngenerating anything."}

Human societies were composed of the same Sapiens both\nbefore and after the invention of writing or radio. In contrast, the invention\nof computers constitutes a revolution in membership. Sure, computers also\nhelp the network\u2019s old members (humans) connect in novel ways.

Consequently, since ancient times humans\nhave feared being trapped in a world of illusions. In ancient Greece, Plato\ntold the famous allegory of the cave, in which a group of people are chained\ninside a cave all their lives, facing a blank wall. A screen.

Of course, not everything will be new. For at least\nsome time, most of the old information chains will remain. The network\nwill still contain human-to-human chains, like families, and human-to-\ndocument chains, like churches.

It set up an experiment where two computers\u2014\nnicknamed Alice and Bob\u2014had to exchange encrypted messages, while a\nthird computer named Eve tried to break their encryption. If Eve broke the\nencryption within a given time period, it got points. If it failed, Alice and\nBob scored. After about fifteen thousand exchanges, Alice and Bob came up\nwith a secret code that Eve couldn\u2019t break. Crucially, the Google engineers\nwho conducted the experiment had not taught Alice and Bob anything about\nhow to encrypt messages. The computers created a private language all on\ntheir own.42\nSimilar things are already happening in the world outside research\nlaboratories. For example, the foreign exchange market (forex) is the global\nmarket for exchanging foreign currencies, and it determines the exchange\nrates between, say, the euro and the U.S. dollar. In April 2022, the trade\nvolume on the forex averaged $7.5 trillion per day.

Since the current\ninformation revolution is more momentous than any previous information\nrevolution, it is likely to create unprecedented realities on an unprecedented\nscale.\nIt is important to understand this because we humans are still in control.\nWe don\u2019t know for how long, but we still have the power to shape these\nnew realities. To do so wisely, we need to comprehend what is happening.\nWhen we write computer code, we aren\u2019t just designing a product.

But things are much trickier when physical\nspace is augmented or replaced by cyberspace and when more and more\ntransactions involve only the transfer of information rather than of physical\ngoods or traditional currencies. For example, a citizen of Uruguay may\ndaily interact online with numerous companies that might have no physical\npresence in Uruguay but that provide her with various services.

In order to target her, these companies buy both personal\ninformation and ad space from Google and ByteDance. In addition, Google\nand ByteDance use the information they harvest from her and from millions\nof other users to develop powerful new AI tools that they can then sell to\nvarious governments and corporations throughout the world. Thanks to such\ntransactions, Google and ByteDance are among the richest corporations in\nthe world. So, should her transactions with them be taxed in Uruguay?\nSome think they should. Not just because information from Uruguay\nhelped make these corporations rich, but also because their activities\nundermine taxpaying Uruguayan businesses. Local newspapers, TV\nstations, and movie theaters lose customers and ad revenue to the tech\ngiants. Prospective Uruguayan AI companies also suffer, because they\ncannot compete with Google\u2019s and ByteDance\u2019s massive data troves. But\nthe tech giants reply that none of the relevant transactions involved any\nphysical presence in Uruguay or any monetary payments.

One proposal for addressing the tax\ndilemmas created by the computer network is to redefine nexus. In the\nwords of the economist Marko K\u00f6thenb\u00fcrger, \u201cThe definition of nexus\nbased on a physical presence should be adjusted to include the notion of a\ndigital presence in a country.\u201d49 This implies that even if Google and\nByteDance have no physical presence in Uruguay, the fact that people in\nUruguay use their online services should nevertheless make them subject to\ntaxation there. Just as Shell and BP pay taxes to countries from which they\nextract oil, the tech giants should pay taxes to countries from which they\nextract data.\nThis still leaves open the question of what, exactly, the Uruguayan\ngovernment should tax. For example, suppose Uruguayan citizens shared a\nmillion cat videos through TikTok. ByteDance didn\u2019t charge them or pay\nthem anything for this.

Suppose Uruguayan politicians promote\na new scheme to tax digital transactions. In response, suppose one of the\ntech giants offers to provide a certain politician with valuable information\non Uruguayan voters and tweak its social media and search algorithms to\nsubtly favor that politician, which helps him win the next election.

Belief in technological determinism is dangerous\nbecause it excuses people of all responsibility. Yes, since human societies\nare information networks, inventing new information technologies is bound\nto change society. When people invent printing presses or machine-learning\nalgorithms, it will inevitably lead to a profound social and political\nrevolution. However, humans still have a lot of control over the pace, shape,\nand direction of this revolution\u2014which means we also have a lot of\nresponsibility.\nAt any given moment, our scientific knowledge and technical skills can\nlend themselves to developing any number of different technologies, but we\nhave only finite resources at our disposal. We should make responsible\nchoices about where to invest these resources. Should they be used to\ndevelop a new medicine for malaria, a new wind turbine, or a new\nimmersive video game? There is nothing inevitable about our choice; it\nreflects political, economic, and cultural priorities.\nIn the 1970s, most computer corporations like IBM focused on developing\nbig and costly machines, which they sold to major corporations and\ngovernment agencies. It was technically feasible to develop small, cheap\npersonal computers and sell them to private individuals, but IBM had little\ninterest in that. It didn\u2019t fit its business model. On the other side of the Iron\nCurtain, in the U.S.S.R., the Soviets were also interested in computers, but\nthey were even less inclined than IBM to develop personal computers.

As a result, Moscow was flooded with paperwork.\nBy the 1980s, this unwieldy system of computers was producing 800 billion\ndocuments per year, all destined for the capital.52\nHowever, at a time when IBM and the Soviet government declined to\ndevelop the personal computer, hobbyists like the members of the\nCalifornia Homebrew Computer Club resolved to do it by themselves. It\nwas a conscious ideological decision, influenced by the 1960s\ncounterculture with its anarchist ideas of power to the people and libertarian\ndistrust of governments and big corporations.53\nLeading members of the Homebrew Computer Club, like Steve Jobs and\nSteve Wozniak, had big dreams but little money and didn\u2019t have access to\nthe resources of either corporate America or the government apparatus. Jobs\nand Wozniak sold their personal possessions, like Jobs\u2019s Volkswagen, to\nfinance the creation of the first Apple computer. It was because of such\npersonal decisions, rather than because of the inevitable decree of the\ngoddess of technology, that by 1977 individuals could buy the Apple II\npersonal computer for a price of $1,298\u2014a considerable sum, but within\nreach of middle-class customers.54\nWe can easily imagine an alternative history. Suppose humanity in the\n1970s had access to the same scientific knowledge and technical skills, but\nMcCarthyism had killed the 1960s counterculture and established an\nAmerican totalitarian regime that mirrored the Soviet system. Would we\nhave personal computers today? Of course, personal computers might still\nhave emerged in a different time and place. But in history, time and place\nare crucial, and no two moments are the same. It matters a great deal that\nAmerica was colonized by the Spaniards in the 1490s rather than by the\nOttomans in the 1520s, or that the atom bomb was developed by the\nAmericans in 1945 rather than by the Germans in 1942.

Similarly, when cheap radio sets were\ndeveloped, it meant that almost every family in Germany could afford to\nhave one at home. But how would it be used? Cheap radios could mean that\nwhen a totalitarian leader gave a speech, he could reach the living room of\nevery German family. Or they could mean that every German family could\nchoose to listen to a different radio program, reflecting and cultivating a\ndiversity of political and artistic views.

As computers\nbecome important members of our information network, they are\nincreasingly tasked with discovering truth and maintaining order. For\nexample, the attempt to find the truth about climate change increasingly\ndepends on calculations that only computers can make, and the attempt to\nreach social consensus about climate change increasingly depends on\nrecommendation algorithms that curate our news feeds, and on creative\nalgorithms that write news stories, fake news, and fiction.

Second, analyze\nall that data and identify patterns. Accordingly, empires, churches,\ncorporations, and health-care systems\u2014from ancient China to the modern\nUnited States\u2014have gathered and analyzed data about the behavior of\nmillions of people. However, in all times and places surveillance has been\nincomplete. In democracies like the modern United States, legal limits have\nbeen placed on surveillance to protect privacy and individual rights. In\ntotalitarian regimes like the ancient Qin Empire and the modern U.S.S.R.,\nsurveillance faced no such legal barriers but came up against technical\nboundaries. Not even the most brutal autocrats had the technology\nnecessary to follow everybody all the time. Some level of privacy was\ntherefore the default even in Hitler\u2019s Germany, Stalin\u2019s U.S.S.R., or the\ncopycat Stalinist regime set up in Romania after 1945.\nGheorghe Iosifescu, one of the first computer scientists in Romania,\nrecalled that when computers were first introduced in the 1970s, the\ncountry\u2019s regime was extremely uneasy about this unfamiliar information\ntechnology. One day in 1976 when Iosifescu walked into his office in the\ngovernmental Centrul de Calcul (Center for Calculus), he saw sitting there\nan unfamiliar man in a rumpled suit. Iosifescu greeted the stranger, but the\nman did not respond. Iosifescu introduced himself, but the man remained\nsilent. So Iosifescu sat down at his desk, switched on a large computer, and\nbegan working. The stranger drew his chair closer, watching Iosifescu\u2019s\nevery move.\nThroughout the day Iosifescu repeatedly tried to strike up a conversation,\nasking the stranger what his name was, why he was there, and what he\nwanted to know. But the man kept his mouth shut and his eyes wide open.\nWhen Iosifescu went home in the evening, the man got up and left too,"}
{"page": 262, "content": "without saying goodbye. Iosifescu knew better than to ask any further\nquestions; the man was obviously an agent of the dreaded Romanian secret\npolice, the Securitate.\nThe next morning, when Iosifescu came to work, the agent was already\nthere. He again sat at Iosifescu\u2019s desk all day, silently taking notes in a little\nnotepad. This continued for the next thirteen years, until the collapse of the\ncommunist regime in 1989. After sitting at the same desk for all those years,\nIosifescu never even learned the agent\u2019s name.1\nIosifescu knew that other Securitate agents and informers were probably\nmonitoring him outside the office, too. His expertise with a powerful and\npotentially subversive technology made him a prime target. But in truth, the\nparanoid regime of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu regarded all twenty million\nRomanian citizens as targets. If it was possible, Ceau\u015fescu would have\nplaced every one of them under constant surveillance. He actually made\nsome steps in that direction. Before he came to power, in 1965, the\nSecuritate had just 1 electronic surveillance center in Bucharest and 11\nmore in provincial cities. By 1978, Bucharest alone was monitored by 10\nelectronic surveillance centers, 248 centers scrutinized the provinces, and\nan additional 1,000 portable surveillance units were moved around to\neavesdrop on remote villages and holiday resorts.2\nWhen, in the late 1970s, Securitate agents discovered that some\nRomanians were writing anonymous letters to Radio Free Europe criticizing\nthe regime, Ceau\u015fescu orchestrated a nationwide effort to collect\nhandwriting samples from all twenty million Romanian citizens. Schools\nand universities were forced to hand in essays from every student.\nEmployers had to request each employee to submit a handwritten CV and\nthen forward it to the Securitate. \u201cWhat about retirees, and the\nunemployed?\u201d asked one of Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s aides. \u201cInvent some kind of new\nform!\u201d commanded the dictator. \u201cSomething they will have to fill in.\u201d Some\nof the subversive letters, however, were typed, so Ceau\u015fescu also had every\nstate-owned typewriter in the country registered, with samples filed away in"}

Given that\neven Securitate agents needed to sleep, it would probably have required at\nleast forty million of them to keep the twenty million Romanian citizens\nunder constant surveillance. Ceau\u015fescu had only about forty thousand\nSecuritate agents.4 And even if Ceau\u015fescu could somehow conjure forty\nmillion agents, that would only have presented new problems, because the\nregime needed to monitor its own agents, too. Like Stalin, Ceau\u015fescu\ndistrusted his own agents and officials more than anyone else, especially\nafter his spy chief\u2014Ion Mihai Pacepa\u2014defected to the United States in\n1978. Politburo members, high-ranking officials, army generals, and\nSecuritate chiefs were living under even closer surveillance than Iosifescu.\nAs the ranks of the secret police swelled, more agents were needed to spy\non all these agents.5\nOne solution was to have people spy on one another. In addition to its\n40,000 professional agents, the Securitate relied on 400,000 civilian\ninformers.6 People often informed on their neighbors, colleagues, friends,\nand even closest family members. But no matter how many informants a\nsecret police employed, gathering all that data was not sufficient to create a\ntotal surveillance regime. Suppose the Securitate succeeded in recruiting\nenough agents and informers to watch everyone twenty-four hours a day. At\nthe end of each day, every agent and informer would have had to compile a\nreport on what they observed. Securitate headquarters would have been\nflooded by 20 million reports every day\u2014or 7.3 billion reports a year.\nUnless analyzed, it was just an ocean of paper.

Identifying patterns requires both the\nability to create ideas and the ability to make decisions. For example, how\ndo human analysts identify someone as a \u201csuspected terrorist\u201d that merits\ncloser attention? First, they create a set of general criteria, such as \u201creading\nextremist literature,\u201d \u201cbefriending known terrorists,\u201d and \u201chaving technical\nknowledge necessary to produce dangerous weapons.\u201d Then they need to\ndecide whether a particular individual meets enough of these criteria to be\nlabeled a suspected terrorist.

By the\n2010s humans were increasingly leaving it to algorithms to decide. Around\n2014\u201315 the U.S. National Security Agency deployed an AI tool called\nSkynet that placed people on a \u201csuspected terrorists\u201d list based on the\nelectronic patterns of their communications, writings, travel, and social\nmedia postings. According to one report, that AI tool \u201cengages in mass\nsurveillance of Pakistan\u2019s mobile phone network, and then uses a machine\nlearning algorithm on the cellular network metadata of 55 million people to\ntry and rate each person\u2019s likelihood of being a terrorist.\u201d A former director\nof both the CIA and the NSA proclaimed that \u201cwe kill people based on\nmetadata.\u201d10 Skynet\u2019s reliability has been severely criticized, but by the\n2020s such technology has become far more sophisticated and has been\ndeployed by a lot more governments.

Of course, computers remain fallible, as we shall explore in depth\nin chapter 8. They may well classify innocent people as terrorists or may\ncreate a false model for radicalization. At an even more fundamental level,\nit is questionable whether the systems\u2019 definition of things like terrorism are\nobjective. There is a long history of regimes using the label \u201cterrorist\u201d to\ncover any and all opposition. In the Soviet Union, anyone who opposed the\nregime was a terrorist. Consequently, when an AI labels someone a\n\u201cterrorist\u201d it might reflect ideological biases rather than objective facts.

But\nin a world where computers monitor humans, it may become possible for\nthe first time in history to completely annihilate privacy. The most extreme\nand well-known cases of intrusive surveillance involve either exceptional\ntimes of emergency, like the COVID-19 pandemic, or places seen as\nexceptional to the normal order of things, such as the Occupied Palestinian\nTerritories, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China, the region\nof Kashmir in India, Russian-occupied Crimea, the U.S.-Mexico border,\nand the Afghanistan-Pakistan borderlands. In these exceptional times and\nplaces, new surveillance technologies, combined with draconian laws and\nheavy police or military presence, have relentlessly monitored and\ncontrolled people\u2019s movements, actions, and even feelings.21 What is crucial\nto realize, though, is that AI-based surveillance tools are being deployed on\nan enormous scale, and not only in such \u201cstates of exception.\u201d22 They are\nnow part and parcel of normal life everywhere.

If a government\nwishes, its surveillance network can reach everywhere, from markets to\nplaces of worship, from schools to private residences. (And while not every\ngovernment is willing or able to install cameras inside people\u2019s homes,\nalgorithms regularly watch us even in our living rooms, bedrooms and\nbathrooms via our own computers and smartphones.)\nGovernmental surveillance networks also routinely collect biometric data\nfrom entire populations, with or without their knowledge.

Ultimately, AI-powered surveillance technology\ncould result in the creation of total surveillance regimes that monitor\ncitizens around the clock and facilitate new kinds of ubiquitous and\nautomated totalitarian repression. A case in point: Iran\u2019s hijab laws.\nAfter Iran became an Islamic theocracy in 1979, the new regime made it\ncompulsory for women to wear the hijab. But the Iranian morality police\nfound it difficult to enforce this rule. They couldn\u2019t place a police officer on\nevery street corner, and public confrontations with women who went\nunveiled occasionally aroused resistance and resentment. In 2022, Iran\nrelegated much of the job of enforcing the hijab laws to a countrywide\nsystem of facial recognition algorithms that relentlessly monitor both\nphysical spaces and online environments.30 A top Iranian official explained\nthat the system would \u201cidentify inappropriate and unusual movements\u201d\nincluding \u201cfailure to observe hijab laws.\u201d The head of Iran\u2019s parliamentary\nlegal and judicial committee, Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, said in another\ninterview that \u201cthe use of face recording cameras can systematically\nimplement this task and reduce the presence of the police, as a result of\nwhich there will be no more clashes between the police and citizens.\u201d31\nShortly afterward, on September 16, 2022, the 22-year-old Mahsa Amini\ndied in the custody of Iran\u2019s morality police, after being arrested for not\nwearing her hijab properly.32 A wave of protests erupted, known as the\n\u201cWoman, Life, Freedom\u201d movement. Hundreds of thousands of women and\ngirls removed their headscarves, and some publicly burned their hijabs, and\ndanced around the bonfires. To clamp down on the protests, Iranian\nauthorities once again turned to their AI surveillance system, which relies\non facial recognition software, geolocation, analysis of web traffic, and\npreexisting databases. More than 19,000 people were arrested throughout\nIran, and more than 500 were killed.33"}
{"page": 276, "content": "On April 8, 2023, Iran\u2019s chief of police announced that beginning on April\n15, 2023, an intense new campaign would ramp up the use of facial\nrecognition technology.

If a woman was caught\nrepeating the offense, she would be ordered to immobilize her car for a\npredetermined period, and if she failed to comply, the car would be\nconfiscated.34\nTwo months later, on June 14, 2023, the spokesperson of Iran\u2019s police\nboasted that the automated surveillance system sent almost one million\nSMS warning messages to women who had been captured unveiled in their\nprivate cars. The system was apparently able to automatically determine\nthat it was seeing an unveiled woman rather than a man, identify the\nwoman, and retrieve her cellphone number. The system further \u201cissued\n133,174 SMS messages requiring the immobilization of vehicles for two\nweeks, confiscated 2,000 cars, and referred more than 4,000 \u2018repeat\noffenders\u2019 to the judiciary.\u201d35\nA 52-year-old woman named Maryam shared with Amnesty International\nher experience with the surveillance system. \u201cThe first time I received a\nwarning for not wearing a headscarf while driving, I was passing through an\nintersection when a camera captured a photo and I immediately received a\nwarning text message. The second time, I had done some shopping, and I\nwas bringing the bags into the car, my scarf fell off, and I received a\nmessage noting that due to violating compulsory veiling laws, my car had\nbeen subjected to \u2018systematic impoundment\u2019 for a period of fifteen days. I\ndid not know what this meant. I asked around and found out through\nrelatives that this meant I had to immobilize my car for fifteen days.\u201d36\nMaryam\u2019s testimony indicates that the AI sends its threatening messages\nwithin seconds, with no time for any human to review and authorize the\nprocedure.\nPenalties went far beyond the immobilization or confiscation of vehicles."}

In\none typical case, a woman employee at the Land of Happiness amusement\npark east of Tehran was photographed without a hijab, and the image\ncirculated on social media.

Jealous partners, for\nexample, have always wanted to know where their spouses were at every\nmoment and demanded explanations for any little deviation from routines.\nToday, armed with a smartphone and some cheap software, they can easily\nestablish marital dictatorships. They can monitor every conversation and\nevery movement, record phone logs, track social media posts and web page\nsearches, and even activate the cameras and microphones of a spouse\u2019s\nphone to serve as a spying device. The U.S.-based National Network to End\nDomestic Violence found that more than half of domestic abusers used such\n\u201cstalkware\u201d technology. Even in New York a spouse may find themselves\nmonitored and restricted, as if they lived in a totalitarian state.41\nA growing percentage of employees\u2014from office workers to truck drivers\n\u2014are also now being surveilled by their employers. Bosses can pinpoint\nwhere employees are at any moment, how much time they spend in the\ntoilet, whether they read personal emails at work, and how fast they\ncomplete each task.42 Corporations are similarly monitoring their customers,\nwanting to know their likes and dislikes, to predict future behavior, and to\nevaluate risks and opportunities. For example, vehicles monitor their\ndrivers\u2019 behavior and share the data with the algorithms of the insurance\ncompanies, which raise the premiums they charge \u201cbad drivers\u201d and lower\nthe premiums for \u201cgood drivers.\u201d43 The American scholar Shoshana Zuboff\nhas termed this ever-expanding commercial monitoring system\n\u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d44\nIn addition to all these varieties of top-down surveillance, there are peer-\nto-peer systems in which individuals constantly monitor one another.

It is the\nusers themselves\u2014rather than some sophisticated AI algorithm\u2014who\ndetermine whether a restaurant is worth visiting. People who ate in the\nrestaurant can score it on a 1 to 5 scale, and also add photos and written\nreviews. The Tripadvisor algorithm merely aggregates the data, calculates\nthe restaurant\u2019s average score, ranks the restaurant compared with others of\nits kind, and makes the results available for everybody to see.\nThe algorithm simultaneously ranks the guests, too. For posting reviews\nor travel articles, users receive 100 points; for uploading photos or videos,\n30 points; for posting in a forum, 20 points; for rating establishments, 5\npoints; and for casting votes for others\u2019 reviews, 1 point. Users are then\nranked from Level 1 (300 points) to Level 6 (10,000 points) and receive\nperks accordingly. Users who violate the system\u2019s rules\u2014for example, by\nsubmitting racist comments or trying to blackmail a restaurant by writing an\nunjustified bad review\u2014may be penalized or kicked out of the system\naltogether.

But in doing so, they have\nalso shifted the border between private and public spaces. Traditionally, the\nrelationship between the customer and a waiter, say, was a relatively private\naffair.

For better or worse, the balance of power tilts in favor of the\ncustomers, while the staff find themselves more exposed than before to the\npublic gaze. As the author and journalist Linda Kinstler put it, \u201cBefore\nTripadvisor, the customer was only nominally king. After, he became a\nveritable tyrant, with the power to make or break lives.\u201d46 The same loss of\nprivacy is felt today by millions of taxi drivers, barbers, beauticians, and\nother service providers. In the past, stepping into a taxi or barbershop meant\nstepping into someone\u2019s private space. Now, when customers come into\nyour taxi or barbershop, they bring cameras, microphones, a surveillance\nnetwork, and thousands of potential viewers with them.47 This is the\nfoundation of a nongovernmental peer-to-peer surveillance network.\nTHE SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM\nPeer-to-peer surveillance systems typically operate by aggregating many\npoints to determine an overall score. Another type of surveillance network\ntakes this \u201cscore logic\u201d to its ultimate conclusion. This is the social credit\nsystem, which seeks to give people points for everything and produce an\noverall personal score that will influence everything. The last time humans\ncame up with such an ambitious points system was five thousand years ago\nin Mesopotamia, when money was invented. One way to think of the social\ncredit system is as a new kind of money.\nMoney is points that people accumulate by selling certain products and\nservices, and then use to buy other products and services. Some countries\ncall their \u201cpoints\u201d dollars, whereas other countries call them euros, yen, or\nrenminbi. The points can take the form of coins, banknotes, or bits in a"}
{"page": 281, "content": "digital bank account. The points themselves are, of course, intrinsically\nworthless. You cannot eat coins or wear banknotes. Their value lies in the\nfact that they serve as accounting tokens that society uses to keep track of\nour individual scores.\nMoney revolutionized economic relations, social interactions, and human\npsychology. But like surveillance, money has had its limitations and could\nnot reach everywhere. Even in the most capitalist societies, there have\nalways been places that money didn\u2019t penetrate, and there have always been\nmany things that lacked a monetary value. How much is a smile worth?\nHow much money does a person earn for visiting their grandparents?48\nFor scoring those things that money can\u2019t buy, there was an alternative\nnonmonetary system, which has been given different names: honor, status,\nreputation. What social credit systems seek is a standardized valuation of\nthe reputation market. Social credit is a new points system that ascribes\nprecise values even to smiles and family visits. To appreciate how\nrevolutionary and far-reaching this is, let\u2019s examine in brief how the\nreputation market has hitherto differed from the money market. This will\nhelp us understand what might happen to social relations if the principles of\nthe money market are suddenly extended to the reputation market.\nOne major difference between money and reputation is that money has\ntended to be a mathematical construct based on precise calculations,\nwhereas the sphere of reputation has been resistant to precise numerical\nevaluation. For example, medieval aristocrats graded themselves in\nhierarchical ranks such as dukes, counts, and viscounts, but nobody was\ncounting reputation points. Customers in a medieval market usually knew\nhow many coins they had in their purses and the price of every product in\nthe stalls. In the money market, no coin goes uncounted. In contrast, knights\nin a medieval reputational market didn\u2019t know the exact amount of honor\nthat different actions might accrue, nor could they be sure of their overall\nscore. Would fighting bravely in battle bring a knight 10 honor points, or\n100? And what if nobody saw and recorded their bravery? Indeed, even"}
{"page": 282, "content": "assuming it was noticed, different people might assign it different values.\nThis lack of precision wasn\u2019t a bug in the system but a crucial feature.\n\u201cCalculating\u201d was a synonym for cunning and scheming. Acting honorably\nwas supposed to reflect an inner virtue, rather than a pursuit of external\nrewards.49\nThis difference between the scrupulous money market and the ill-defined\nreputation market still prevails. The owner of a bistro always notices and\ncomplains if you don\u2019t pay for your meal in full; every item on the menu\nhas a precise price. But how would the owner even know if society failed to\nregister some good deed they performed? Whom could they complain to if\nthey weren\u2019t properly rewarded for helping an elderly customer or for being\nextra patient with a rude customer? In some cases, they might now try\ncomplaining to Tripadvisor, which collapses the boundary between the\nmoney market and the reputation market, turning the fuzzy reputation of\nrestaurants and hotels into a mathematical system of precise points. The\nidea of social credit is to expand this surveillance method from restaurants\nand hotels to everything. In the most extreme type of social credit systems,\nevery person gets an overall reputation score that takes into account\nwhatever they do and determines everything they can do.\nFor example, you might earn 10 points for picking up trash from the\nstreet, get another 20 points for helping an old lady cross the road, and lose\n15 points for playing the drums and disturbing the neighbors. If you get a\nhigh enough score, it might give you priority when buying train tickets or a\nleg up when applying to university. If you get a low score, potential\nemployers may refuse to give you a job, and potential dates may refuse\nyour advances. Insurance companies may demand higher premiums, and\njudges may inflict harsher sentences.\nSome people might see social credit systems as a way to reward pro-social\nbehavior, punish egotistical acts, and create kinder and more harmonious\nsocieties. The Chinese government, for example, explains that its social\ncredit systems could help fight corruption, scams, tax evasion, false"}

Even worse, a\ncomprehensive social credit system will annihilate privacy and effectively\nturn life into a never-ending job interview. Anything you do, anytime,\nanywhere, might affect your chances of getting a job, a bank loan, a\nhusband, or a prison sentence. You got drunk at a college party and did\nsomething legal but shameful? You participated in a political\ndemonstration? You\u2019re friends with someone who has a low credit score?\nThis will be part of your job interview\u2014or criminal sentencing\u2014both in the\nshort term and even decades later. The social credit system might thereby\nbecome a totalitarian control system.\nOf course, the reputation market always controlled people and made them\nconform to the prevailing social norms. In most societies people have\nalways feared losing face even more than they have feared losing money.\nMany more people commit suicide due to shame and guilt than due to\neconomic distress. Even when people kill themselves after being fired from\ntheir job or after their business goes bankrupt, they are usually pushed over\nthe edge by the social humiliation it involves rather than by the economic\nhardship per se.51\nBut the uncertainty and the subjectivity of the reputation market have\npreviously limited its potential for totalitarian control. Since nobody knew\nthe precise value of each social interaction, and since nobody could\npossibly keep tabs on all interactions, there was significant room for\nmaneuver. When you went to a college party, you might have behaved in a\nway that earned the respect of your friends, without worrying what future\nemployers might think. When you went to a job interview, you knew none\nof your friends would be there.

Even in their own homes or while trying to enjoy\na relaxed vacation, people would have to be extremely careful about every\ndeed and word, as if they were performing onstage in front of millions. This\ncould create an incredibly stressful lifestyle, destructive to people\u2019s well-\nbeing as well as to the functioning of society.

He was writing partly from bitter personal\nexperience. When Solzhenitsyn served as a captain in the Red Army during\nWorld War II, he maintained a private correspondence with a school friend\nin which he occasionally criticized Stalin. To be on the safe side, he did not\nmention the dictator by name and spoke only about \u201cthe man with the\nmustache.\u201d It availed him little. His letters were intercepted and read by the\nsecret police, and in February 1945, while serving on the front line in\nGermany, he was arrested. He spent the next eight years in labor camps.1\nMany of Solzhenitsyn\u2019s hard-won insights and stories are still relevant to\nunderstanding the development of information networks in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nOne story recounts events at a district party conference in Moscow\nProvince in the late 1930s, at the height of the Stalinist Great Terror. A call\nwas made to pay tribute to Stalin, and the audience\u2014who of course knew\nthat they were being carefully watched\u2014burst into applause.

As discussed in\nprevious chapters, contrary to the naive view, information is often used to\ncreate order rather than discover truth. On the face of it, Stalin\u2019s agents in\nthe Moscow conference used the \u201cclapping test\u201d as a way to uncover the\ntruth about the audience. It was a loyalty test, which assumed that the\nlonger you clapped, the more you loved Stalin. In many contexts, this\nassumption is not unreasonable. But in the context of Moscow in the late\n1930s, the nature of the applause changed. Since participants in the\nconference knew they were being watched, and since they knew the\nconsequences of any hint of disloyalty, they clapped out of terror rather than\nlove. The paper factory director might have been the first to stop not\nbecause he was the least loyal but perhaps because he was the most honest,\nor even simply because his hands hurt the most.\nWhile the clapping test didn\u2019t discover the truth about people, it was\nefficient in imposing order and forcing people to behave in a certain way.\nOver time, such methods cultivated servility, hypocrisy, and cynicism.

In fact, the\nSoviet information network ignored many important aspects of human\nnature, and it was in complete denial regarding the terrible suffering its\npolicies inflicted on its own citizens. Instead of producing wisdom, it\nproduced order, and instead of revealing the universal truth about humans, it\nactually created a new type of human\u2014Homo sovieticus.\nAs defined by the dissident Soviet philosopher and satirist Aleksandr\nZinovyev, Homo sovieticus were servile and cynical humans, lacking all\ninitiative or independent thinking, passively obeying even the most\nludicrous orders, and indifferent to the results of their actions.3 The Soviet\ninformation network created Homo sovieticus through surveillance,\npunishments, and rewards.

For example, in 2012 users\nwere watching about 100 million hours of videos every day on YouTube.\nThat was not enough for company executives, who set their algorithms an\nambitious goal: 1 billion hours a day by 2016.4 Through trial-and-error\nexperiments on millions of people, the YouTube algorithms discovered the\nsame pattern that Facebook algorithms also learned: outrage drives\nengagement up, while moderation tends not to. Accordingly, the YouTube\nalgorithms began recommending outrageous conspiracy theories to millions\nof viewers while ignoring more moderate content. By 2016, users were\nindeed watching 1 billion hours every day on YouTube.5\nYouTubers who were particularly intent on gaining attention noticed that\nwhen they posted an outrageous video full of lies, the algorithm rewarded\nthem by recommending the video to numerous users and increasing the\nYouTubers\u2019 popularity and income. In contrast, when they dialed down the\noutrage and stuck to the truth, the algorithm tended to ignore them. Within a\nfew months of such reinforcement learning, the algorithm turned many\nYouTubers into trolls.6\nThe social and political consequences were far-reaching. For example, as\nthe journalist Max Fisher documented in his 2022 book, The Chaos\nMachine, YouTube algorithms became an important engine for the rise of\nthe Brazilian far right and for turning Jair Bolsonaro from a fringe figure\ninto Brazil\u2019s president.7 While there were other factors contributing to that\npolitical upheaval, it is notable that many of Bolsonaro\u2019s chief supporters\nand aides had originally been YouTubers who rose to fame and power by\nalgorithmic grace.\nA typical example is Carlos Jordy, who in 2017 was a city councilor in the"}

In\n2018, Jordy won a seat in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies (the lower\nhouse of the Brazilian Congress) as one of Bolsonaro\u2019s most dedicated\nsupporters. In an interview with Fisher, Jordy frankly said, \u201cIf social media\ndidn\u2019t exist, I wouldn\u2019t be here [and] Jair Bolsonaro wouldn\u2019t be president.\u201d\nThe latter claim may well be a self-serving exaggeration, but there is no\ndenying that social media played an important part in Bolsonaro\u2019s rise.\nAnother YouTuber who won a seat in Brazil\u2019s Chamber of Deputies in\n2018 was Kim Kataguiri, one of the leaders of the Movimento Brasil Livre\n(MBL, or Free Brazil Movement). Kataguiri initially used Facebook as his\nmain platform, but his posts were too extreme even for Facebook, which\nbanned some of them for disinformation. So Kataguiri switched over to the\nmore permissive YouTube. In an interview in the MBL headquarters in S\u00e3o\nPaulo, Kataguiri\u2019s aides and other activists explained to Fisher, \u201cWe have\nsomething here that we call the dictatorship of the like.\u201d They explained\nthat YouTubers tend to become steadily more extreme, posting untruthful\nand reckless content \u201cjust because something is going to give you views,\ngoing to give engagement.\u2026 Once you open that door there\u2019s no going\nback, because you always have to go further.\u2026 Flat Earthers, anti-vaxxers,\nconspiracy theories in politics.

We have already made this argument in chapter 6,\nwhen we briefly examined Facebook\u2019s role in instigating the anti-Rohingya\nethnic-cleansing campaign. As noted in that context, however, many people\n\u2014including some of the managers and engineers of Facebook, YouTube,\nand the other tech giants\u2014object to this argument. Since it is one of the\ncentral points of the entire book, it is best to delve deeper into the matter\nand examine more carefully the objections to it.\nThe people who manage Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms\nroutinely try to excuse themselves by shifting the blame from their\nalgorithms to \u201chuman nature.\u201d They argue that it is human nature that\nproduces all the hate and lies on the platforms. The tech giants then claim\nthat due to their commitment to free speech values, they hesitate to censor\nthe expression of genuine human emotions. For example, in 2019 the CEO\nof YouTube, Susan Wojcicki, explained, \u201cThe way that we think about it is:\n\u2018Is this content violating one of our policies?

But\nsocial media algorithms see us, simply, as an attention mine. The algorithms\nreduced the multifaceted range of human emotions\u2014hate, love, outrage,\njoy, confusion\u2014into a single catchall category: engagement. In Myanmar in\n2016, in Brazil in 2018, and in numerous other countries, the algorithms\nscored videos, posts, and all other content solely according to how many\nminutes people engaged with the content and how many times they shared\nit with others. An hour of lies or hatred was ranked higher than ten minutes\nof truth or compassion\u2014or an hour of sleep. The fact that lies and hate tend\nto be psychologically and socially destructive, whereas truth, compassion,\nand sleep are essential for human welfare, was completely lost on the\nalgorithms. Based on this very narrow understanding of humanity, the\nalgorithms helped to create a new social system that encouraged our basest\ninstincts while discouraging us from realizing the full spectrum of the\nhuman potential.\nAs the harmful effects were becoming manifest, the tech giants were\nrepeatedly warned about what was happening, but they failed to step in\nbecause of their faith in the naive view of information. As the platforms\nwere overrun by falsehoods and outrage, executives hoped that if more\npeople were enabled to express themselves more freely, truth would\neventually prevail.

Social\nmedia platforms have been singularly lacking in self-correcting\nmechanisms. In 2014, Facebook employed just a single Burmese-speaking\ncontent moderator to monitor activities in the whole of Myanmar.15 When\nobservers in Myanmar began warning Facebook that it needed to invest\nmore in moderating content, Facebook ignored them. For example, Pwint\nHtun, a Burmese American engineer and telecom executive who grew up in\nrural Myanmar, wrote to Facebook executives repeatedly about the danger.\nIn an email from July 5, 2014\u2014two years before the ethnic-cleansing\ncampaign began\u2014she issued a prophetic warning: \u201cTragically, FB in\nBurma is used like radio in Rwanda during the dark days of genocide.\u201d\nFacebook took no action.\nEven after the attacks on the Rohingya intensified and Facebook faced a\nstorm of criticism, it still refused to hire people with expert local knowledge\nto curate content. Thus, when informed that hate-mongers in Myanmar were\nusing the Burmese word kalar as a racist slur for the Rohingya, Facebook\nreacted in April 2017 by banning from the platform any posts that used the\nword. This revealed Facebook\u2019s utter lack of knowledge about local\nconditions and the Burmese language. In Burmese, kalar is a racist slur\nonly in specific contexts. In other contexts, it is an entirely innocent term.\nThe Burmese word for chair is kalar htaing, and the word for chickpea is\nkalar pae. As Pwint Htun wrote to Facebook in June 2017, banning the term\nkalar from the platform is like banning the letters \u201chell\u201d from \u201chello.\u201d16\nFacebook continued to ignore the need for local expertise.

It has been, for example, the foundational problem of modern\nmilitary thinking, enshrined in Carl von Clausewitz\u2019s theory of war.\nClausewitz was a Prussian general who fought during the Napoleonic Wars."}
{"page": 298, "content": "Following Napoleon\u2019s final defeat in 1815, Clausewitz became the director\nof the Prussian War College. He also began formalizing a grand theory of\nwar. After he died of cholera in 1831, his wife, Marie, edited his unfinished\nmanuscript and published On War in several parts between 1832 and\n1834.22\nOn War created a rational model for understanding war, and it is still the\ndominant military theory today. Its most important maxim is that \u201cwar is the\ncontinuation of policy with other means.\u201d23 This implies that war is not an\nemotional outbreak, a heroic adventure, or a divine punishment. War is not\neven a military phenomenon. Rather, war is a political tool. According to\nClausewitz, military actions are utterly irrational unless they are aligned\nwith some overarching political goal.\nSuppose Mexico contemplates whether to invade and conquer its small\nneighbor, Belize. And suppose a detailed military analysis concludes that if\nthe Mexican army invades, it will achieve a quick and decisive military\nvictory, crushing the small Belize army and conquering the capital,\nBelmopan, in three days. According to Clausewitz, that does not constitute\na rational reason for Mexico to invade. The mere ability to secure military\nvictory is meaningless. The key question the Mexican government should\nask itself is, what political goals will the military success achieve?\nHistory is full of decisive military victories that led to political disasters.\nFor Clausewitz, the most obvious example was close to home: Napoleon\u2019s\ncareer. Nobody disputes the military genius of Napoleon, who was a master\nof both tactics and strategy. But while his string of victories brought\nNapoleon temporary control of vast territories, they failed to secure lasting\npolitical achievements. His military conquests merely drove most European\npowers to unite against him, and his empire collapsed a decade after he\ncrowned himself emperor.\nIndeed, in the long term, Napoleon\u2019s victories ensured the permanent\ndecline of France.

Germany was an even more\nbizarre jigsaw puzzle divided into more than a thousand independent\npolities, loosely held together under the theoretical suzerainty of the Holy\nRoman Empire of the German Nation.24 In 1789, the prospect of a German\nor Italian invasion of France was simply unthinkable, because there was no\nsuch thing as a German or Italian army.\nAs Napoleon expanded his empire into central Europe and the Italian\nPeninsula, he abolished the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, amalgamated\nmany of the smaller German and Italian principalities into larger territorial\nblocs, created a German Confederation of the Rhine and a Kingdom of\nItaly, and sought to unify these territories under his dynastic rule. His\nvictorious armies also spread the ideals of modern nationalism and popular\nsovereignty into the German and Italian lands. Napoleon thought all this\nwould make his empire stronger. In fact, by breaking up traditional\nstructures and giving Germans and Italians a taste of national consolidation,\nNapoleon inadvertently lay the foundations for the ultimate unification of\nGermany (1866\u201371) and of Italy (1848\u201371). These twin processes of\nnational unification were sealed by the German victory over France in the\nFranco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371.

From the overall strategy, lower-ranking\nofficers can then derive tactical goals. The model constructs a clear\nhierarchy between long-term policy, medium-term strategy, and short-term\ntactics. Tactics are considered rational only if they are aligned with some\nstrategic goal, and strategy is considered rational only if it is aligned with\nsome political goal. Even local tactical decisions of a lowly company\ncommander must serve the war\u2019s ultimate political goal.\nSuppose that during the American occupation of Iraq an American\ncompany comes under intense fire from a nearby mosque. The company\ncommander has several different tactical decisions to choose from. He\nmight order the company to retreat. He might order the company to storm\nthe mosque. He might order one of his supporting tanks to blow up the\nmosque. What should the company commander do?\nFrom a purely military perspective, it might seem best for the commander\nto order his tank to blow up the mosque. This would capitalize on the\ntactical advantage that the Americans enjoyed in terms of firepower, avoid\nrisking the lives of his own soldiers, and achieve a decisive tactical victory.\nHowever, from a political perspective, this might be the worst decision the\ncommander could make. Footage of an American tank destroying a mosque\nwould galvanize Iraqi public opinion against the Americans and create\noutrage throughout the wider Muslim world. Storming the mosque might\nalso be a political mistake, because it too could create resentment among\nIraqis, while the cost in American lives could weaken support for the war\namong American voters. Given the political war aims of the United States,\nretreating and conceding tactical defeat might well be the most rational\ndecision."}
{"page": 301, "content": "For Clausewitz, then, rationality means alignment. Pursuing tactical or\nstrategic victories that are misaligned with political goals is irrational. The\nproblem is that the bureaucratic nature of armies makes them highly\nsusceptible to such irrationality. As discussed in chapter 3, by dividing\nreality into separate drawers, bureaucracy encourages the pursuit of narrow\ngoals even when this harms the greater good. Bureaucrats tasked with\naccomplishing a narrow mission may be ignorant of the wider impact of\ntheir actions, and it has always been tricky to ensure that their actions\nremain aligned with the greater good of society. When armies operate along\nbureaucratic lines\u2014as all modern armies do\u2014it creates a huge gap between\na captain commanding a company in the field and the president formulating\nlong-term policy in a distant office. The captain is prone to make decisions\nthat seem reasonable on the ground but that actually undermine the war\u2019s\nultimate goal.\nWe see, then, that the alignment problem has long predated the computer\nrevolution and that the difficulties encountered by builders of present-day\ninformation empires are not unlike those that bedeviled previous would-be\nconquerors. Nevertheless, computers do change the nature of the alignment\nproblem in important ways. No matter how difficult it used to be to ensure\nthat human bureaucrats and soldiers remain aligned with society\u2019s long-\nterm goals, it is going to be even harder to ensure the alignment of\nalgorithmic bureaucrats and autonomous weapon systems.\nTHE PAPER-CLIP NAPOLEON\nOne reason why the alignment problem is particularly dangerous in the\ncontext of the computer network is that this network is likely to become far\nmore powerful than any previous human bureaucracy. A misalignment in\nthe goals of superintelligent computers might result in a catastrophe of\nunprecedented magnitude.

In pursuit\nof this goal, the paper-clip computer conquers the whole of planet Earth,\nkills all the humans, sends expeditions to take over additional planets, and\nuses the enormous resources it acquires to fill the entire galaxy with paper-\nclip factories.\nThe point of the thought experiment is that the computer did exactly what\nit was told (just like the enchanted broomstick in Goethe\u2019s poem). Realizing\nthat it needed electricity, steel, land, and other resources to build more\nfactories and produce more paper clips, and realizing that humans are\nunlikely to give up these resources, the superintelligent computer\neliminated all humans in its single-minded pursuit of its given goal.26\nBostrom\u2019s point was that the problem with computers isn\u2019t that they are\nparticularly evil but that they are particularly powerful. And the more\npowerful the computer, the more careful we need to be about defining its\ngoal in a way that precisely aligns with our ultimate goals.

Because they\nare inorganic entities, they are likely to adopt strategies that would never\noccur to any human and that we are therefore ill-equipped to foresee and\nforestall. Here\u2019s one example: In 2016, Dario Amodei was working on a\nproject called Universe, trying to develop a general-purpose AI that could\nplay hundreds of different computer games. The AI competed well in\nvarious car races, so Amodei next tried it on a boat race. Inexplicably, the\nAI steered its boat right into a harbor and then sailed in endless circles in\nand out of the harbor.\nIt took Amodei considerable time to understand what went wrong. The\nproblem occurred because initially Amodei wasn\u2019t sure how to tell the AI\nthat its goal was to \u201cwin the race.\u201d \u201cWinning\u201d is an unclear concept to an\nalgorithm. Translating \u201cwin the race\u201d into computer language would have\nrequired Amodei to formalize complex concepts like track position and\nplacement among the other boats in the race. So instead, Amodei took the\neasy way and told the boat to maximize its score. He assumed that the score\nwas a good proxy for winning the race. After all, it worked with the car\nraces.\nBut the boat race had a peculiar feature, absent from the car races, that\nallowed the ingenious AI to find a loophole in the game\u2019s rules. The game\nrewarded players with a lot of points for getting ahead of other boats\u2014as in\nthe car races\u2014but it also rewarded them with a few points whenever they\nreplenished their power by docking into a harbor. The AI discovered that if\ninstead of trying to outsail the other boats, it simply went in circles in and\nout of the harbor, it could accumulate more points far faster. Apparently,\nnone of the game\u2019s human developers\u2014nor Dario Amodei\u2014noticed this\nloophole.

Such an ultimate goal by\ndefinition cannot be aligned with anything higher than itself, because there\nis nothing higher. What then makes it rational to place France at the top of\nthe goal hierarchy, rather than Napoleon\u2019s family, Napoleon\u2019s fame,\nNapoleon\u2019s soul, or universal human rights? Clausewitz provides no\nanswer.\nOne might argue that goal number 4\u2014securing the redemption of his\neverlasting soul\u2014cannot be a serious candidate for an ultimate rational\ngoal, because it is based on a belief in mythology. But the same argument\ncan be leveled at all the other goals. Everlasting souls are an intersubjective\ninvention that exist only in people\u2019s minds, and exactly the same is true of\nnations and human rights. Why should Napoleon care about the mythical\nFrance any more than about his mythical soul?\nIndeed, for most of his youth, Napoleon didn\u2019t even consider himself\nFrench.

Many Corsicans continued to resent the French takeover,\nbut the di Buonaparte family swore allegiance to the French king and sent\nNapoleone to military school in mainland France.29\nAt school, Napoleone had to endure a good deal of hazing from his\nclassmates for his Corsican nationalism and his poor command of the\nFrench language.30 His mother tongues were Corsican and Italian, and"}

Deontologists (from\nthe Greek word deon, meaning \u201cduty\u201d) believe that there are some universal\nmoral duties, or moral rules, that apply to everyone. These rules do not rely\non alignment to a higher goal, but rather on their intrinsic goodness. If such\nrules indeed exist, and if we can find a way to program them into\ncomputers, then we can make sure the computer network will be a force for\ngood.\nBut what exactly does \u201cintrinsic goodness\u201d mean? The most famous\nattempt to define an intrinsically good rule was made by Immanuel Kant, a\ncontemporary of Clausewitz and Napoleon. Kant argued that an intrinsically\ngood rule is any rule that I would like to make universal. According to this\nview, a person about to murder someone should stop and go through the\nfollowing thought process: \u201cI am now going to murder a human. Would I\nlike to establish a universal rule saying that it is okay to murder humans? If\nsuch a universal rule is established, then someone might murder me. So\nthere shouldn\u2019t be a universal rule allowing murder. It follows that I too\nshouldn\u2019t murder.\u201d In simpler language, Kant reformulated the old Golden\nRule: \u201cDo unto others what you want them to do to you\u201d (Matthew 7:12).\nThis sounds like a simple and obvious idea: each of us should behave in a\nway we want everyone to behave. But ideas that sound good in the ethereal\nrealm of philosophy often have trouble immigrating to the harsh land of\nhistory. The key question historians would ask Kant is, when you talk about\nuniversal rules, how exactly do you define \u201cuniversal\u201d? Under actual\nhistorical circumstances, when a person is about to commit murder, the first\nstep they often take is to exclude the victim from the universal community\nof humanity.34 This, for example, is what anti-Rohingya extremists like\nWirathu did. As a Buddhist monk, Wirathu was certainly against murdering\nhumans. But he didn\u2019t think this universal rule applied to killing Rohingya,\nwho were seen as subhuman.

Would you\nlike to establish a universal rule saying it is okay to murder humans? If you\ndo that, you and your family might also be murdered.\u201d Eichmann replies,\n\u201cNo, I am not about to murder thousands of humans. I am about to murder\nthousands of Jews.

If an entity\ncan be defined as either \u201ca Jew\u201d or \u201ca human,\u201d we should use the more\nuniversal term \u201chuman.\u201d However, the whole point of Nazi ideology was to\ndeny the humanity of Jews. In addition, note that Jews are not just humans.\nThey are also animals, and they are also organisms. Since animals and\norganisms are obviously more universal categories than \u201chuman,\u201d if you\nfollow the Kantian argument to its logical conclusion, it might push us to\nadopt an extreme vegan position. Since we are organisms, does it mean we\nshould object to the killing of any organism, down even to tomatoes or\namoebas?\nIn history, many if not most conflicts concern the definition of identities.\nEverybody accepts that murder is wrong, but thinks that only killing\nmembers of the in-group qualifies as \u201cmurder,\u201d whereas killing someone\nfrom an out-group is not.

A Kantian computer that doesn\u2019t want to be killed\nhas no reason to object to a universal rule saying \u201cit is okay to kill\norganisms\u201d; such a rule does not endanger the nonorganic computer.\nAlternatively, being inorganic entities, computers may have no qualms\nabout dying.

If the car has to choose between killing a human and killing a cat, it\nshould drive over the cat, because presumably the cat has a lesser capacity\nto suffer.

If our main\nfear about computer networks is that their misaligned goals might inflict\nterrible suffering on humans and perhaps on other sentient beings, then the\nutilitarian solution seems both obvious and attractive. When creating the\ncomputer network, we just need to instruct it to minimize suffering and\nmaximize happiness. If Facebook had told its algorithms \u201cmaximize\nhappiness\u201d instead of \u201cmaximize user engagement,\u201d all would allegedly\nhave been well. It is worth noting that this utilitarian approach is indeed\npopular in Silicon Valley, championed in particular by the effective altruism\nmovement.38\nUnfortunately, as with the deontologist solution, what sounds simple in the\ntheoretical realm of philosophy becomes fiendishly complex in the practical\nland of history. The problem for utilitarians is that we don\u2019t possess a\ncalculus of suffering. We don\u2019t know how many \u201csuffering points\u201d or\n\u201chappiness points\u201d to assign to particular events, so in complex historical\nsituations it is extremely difficult to calculate whether a given action\nincreases or decreases the overall amount of suffering in the world.\nUtilitarianism is at its best in situations when the scales of suffering are\nvery clearly tipped in one direction. When confronted by Eichmann,\nutilitarians don\u2019t need to get into any complicated debates about identity.\nThey just need to point out that the Holocaust caused immense suffering to\nthe Jews, without providing equivalent benefits to anyone else, including\nthe Germans. There was no compelling military or economic need for the\nGermans to murder millions of Jews. The utilitarian case against the\nHolocaust is overwhelming."}

Kant, for example, condemned\nhomosexuality on the grounds that it is \u201ccontrary to natural instinct and to\nanimal nature\u201d and that it therefore degrades a person \u201cbelow the level of\nthe animals.\u201d Kant further fulminated that because such acts are contrary to\nnature, they \u201cmake man unworthy of his humanity.

In light of the above\ndiscussion of dehumanization as a prelude to massacre, it is also noteworthy\nhow Kant dehumanized gay people. The view that homosexuality is\ncontrary to nature and deprives people of their humanity paved the way for\nNazis like Eichmann to justify murdering homosexuals in concentration\ncamps. Since homosexuals were allegedly below the level of animals, the\nKantian rule against murdering humans didn\u2019t apply to them.40\nUtilitarians find it easy to dismiss Kant\u2019s sexual theories, and Bentham\nindeed was one of the first modern European thinkers who favored the\ndecriminalization of homosexuality.41 Utilitarians argue that criminalizing\nhomosexuality in the name of some dubious universal rule causes\ntremendous suffering to millions of people, without offering any substantial\nbenefits to others.

Libertarians, when\nasked about the immediate social harms of unrestricted free speech or the\ntotal abolition of taxes, express a similar faith that future benefits will\noutweigh any short-term damage. The danger of utilitarianism is that if you\nhave a strong enough belief in a future utopia, it can become an open\nlicense to inflict terrible suffering in the present. Indeed, this is a trick\ntraditional religions discovered thousands of years ago. The crimes of this\nworld could too easily be excused by the promises of future salvation.\nCOMPUTER MYTHOLOGY\nHow then did bureaucratic systems throughout history set their ultimate"}

No matter how rational\nwere the officials, engineers, tax collectors, and accountants, they were\nultimately in the service of this or that mythmaker. To paraphrase John\nMaynard Keynes, practical people, who believe themselves to be quite\nexempt from any religious influence, are usually the slaves of some\nmythmaker. Even nuclear physicists have found themselves obeying the\ncommands of Shiite ayatollahs and communist apparatchiks.\nThe alignment problem turns out to be, at heart, a problem of mythology.\nNazi administrators could have been committed deontologists or\nutilitarians, but they would still have murdered millions so long as they\nunderstood the world in terms of a racist mythology. If you start with the\nmythological belief that Jews are demonic monsters bent on destroying\nhumanity, then both deontologists and utilitarians can find many logical\narguments why the Jews should be killed.\nAn analogous problem might well afflict computers. Of course, they\ncannot \u201cbelieve\u201d in any mythology, because they are nonconscious entities\nthat don\u2019t believe in anything. As long as they lack subjectivity, how can\nthey hold intersubjective beliefs? However, one of the most important\nthings to realize about computers is that when a lot of computers\ncommunicate with one another, they can create inter-computer realities,\nanalogous to the intersubjective realities produced by networks of humans.\nThese inter-computer realities may eventually become as powerful\u2014and as\ndangerous\u2014as human-made intersubjective myths.\nThis is a very complicated argument, but it is another of the central\narguments of the book, so let\u2019s go over it carefully. First, let\u2019s try to\nunderstand what inter-computer realities are. As an initial example, consider\na one-player computer game. In such a game, you can wander inside a\nvirtual landscape that exists as information within one computer. If you see\na rock, that rock is not made of atoms. It is made of bits inside a single\ncomputer. When several computers are linked to one another, they can\ncreate inter-computer realities. Several players using different computers"}

If they see a rock,\nthat rock is made of bits in several computers.45\nJust as intersubjective realities like money and gods can influence the\nphysical reality outside people\u2019s minds, so inter-computer realities can\ninfluence reality outside the computers. In 2016 the game Pok\u00e9mon Go took\nthe world by storm and was downloaded hundreds of millions of times by\nthe end of the year.46 Pok\u00e9mon Go is an augmented reality mobile game.\nPlayers can use their smartphones to locate, fight, and capture virtual\ncreatures called Pok\u00e9mon, which seem to exist in the physical world. I once\nwent with my nephew Matan on such a Pok\u00e9mon hunt. Walking around his\nneighborhood, I saw only houses, trees, rocks, cars, people, cats, dogs, and\npigeons. I didn\u2019t see any Pok\u00e9mon, because I didn\u2019t have a smartphone. But\nMatan, looking around through his smartphone lens, could \u201csee\u201d Pok\u00e9mon\nstanding on a rock or hiding behind a tree.\nThough I couldn\u2019t see the creatures, they were obviously not confined to\nMatan\u2019s smartphone, because other people could \u201csee\u201d them too. For\nexample, we encountered two other kids who were hunting the same\nPok\u00e9mon. If Matan managed to capture a Pok\u00e9mon, the other kids could\nimmediately observe what happened. The Pok\u00e9mon were inter-computer\nentities. They existed as bits in a computer network rather than as atoms in\nthe physical world, but they could nevertheless interact with the physical\nworld and influence it, as it were, in various ways.\nNow let\u2019s examine a more consequential example of inter-computer\nrealities. Consider the rank that a website gets in a Google search. When we\ngoogle for news, flight tickets, or restaurant recommendations, one website\nappears at the top of the first Google page, whereas another is relegated to\nthe middle of the fiftieth page. What exactly is this Google rank, and how is\nit determined? The Google algorithm determines the website\u2019s Google rank\nby assigning points to various parameters, such as how many people visit\nthe website and how many other websites link to it. The rank itself is an\ninter-computer reality, existing in a network connecting billions of"}

For a news outlet, a travel agency, or a\nrestaurant it matters a great deal whether its website appears at the top of\nthe first Google page or in the middle of the fiftieth page.47\nSince the Google rank is so important, people use all kinds of tricks to\nmanipulate the Google algorithm to give their website a higher rank. For\nexample, they may use bots to generate more traffic to the website.48 This is\na widespread phenomenon in social media too, where coordinated bot\narmies are constantly manipulating the algorithms of YouTube, Facebook,\nor Twitter. If a tweet goes viral, is it because humans are really interested in\nit, or because thousands of bots managed to fool the Twitter algorithm?49\nInter-computer realities like Pok\u00e9mon and Google ranks are analogous to\nintersubjective realities like the sanctity that humans ascribe to temples and\ncities. I lived much of my life in one of the holiest places on earth\u2014the city\nof Jerusalem. Objectively, it is an ordinary place. As you walk around\nJerusalem, you see houses, trees, rocks, cars, people, cats, dogs, and\npigeons, as in any other city. But many people nevertheless imagine it to be\nan extraordinary place, full of gods, angels, and holy stones. They believe in\nthis so strongly that they sometimes fight over possession of the city or of\nspecific holy buildings and sacred stones, most notably the Holy Rock,\nlocated under the Dome of the Rock on Temple Mount. The Palestinian\nphilosopher Sari Nusseibeh observed that \u201cJews and Muslims, acting on\nreligious beliefs and backed up by nuclear capabilities, are poised to engage\nin history\u2019s worst-ever massacre of human beings, over a rock.\u201d50 They\ndon\u2019t fight over the atoms that compose the rock; they fight over its\n\u201csanctity,\u201d a bit like kids fighting over a Pok\u00e9mon. The sanctity of the Holy\nRock, and of Jerusalem generally, is an intersubjective phenomenon that\nexists in the communication network connecting many human minds. For\nthousands of years wars were fought over intersubjective entities like holy\nrocks. In the twenty-first century, we might see wars fought over inter-\ncomputer entities."}

As computers become more intelligent and more creative,\nthey are likely to create new inter-computer financial devices. Gold coins\nand dollars are intersubjective entities.

The idea behind them\nwas invented by humans, and their value still depends on human beliefs, but\nthey cannot exist outside the computer network. In addition, they are\nincreasingly traded by algorithms so that their value depends on the\ncalculations of algorithms and not just on human beliefs.\nWhat if in ten or fifty years computers create a new kind of\ncryptocurrency or some other financial device that becomes a vital tool for\ntrading and investing\u2014and a potential source for political crises and\nconflicts? Recall that the 2007\u20138 global financial crisis was instigated by\ncollateralized debt obligations. These financial devices were invented by a\nhandful of mathematicians and investment whiz kids and were almost\nunintelligible for most humans, including regulators. This led to an\noversight failure and to a global catastrophe.51 Computers may well create\nfinancial devices that will be orders of magnitude more complex than CDOs\nand that will be intelligible only to other computers. The result could be a\nfinancial and political crisis even worse than that of 2007\u20138.\nThroughout history, economics and politics required that we understand\nthe intersubjective realities invented by people\u2014like religions, nations, and\ncurrencies.

The\nU.S. legal system already recognizes corporations as legal persons that\npossess rights such as freedom of speech. In Citizens United v.

Now computers may acquire\ncomparable abilities.\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad news. If computers lacked connectivity and\ncreativity, they would not be very useful. We increasingly rely on computers\nto manage our money, drive our vehicles, reduce pollution, and discover\nnew medicines, precisely because computers can directly communicate with\none another, spot patterns where we can\u2019t, and construct models that might\nnever occur to us.

The\nmountains of information collected by Soviet bureaucracy about the kulaks\nweren\u2019t an objective truth, but they created a new intersubjective truth.\nKnowing that someone was a kulak became one of the most important\nthings to know about a Soviet person, even though the category was\nfictitious.\nOn an even larger scale, from the sixteenth to the twentieth century,\nnumerous colonial bureaucracies in the Americas, from Brazil through\nMexico and the Caribbean to the United States, created a racist mythology\nand came up with all kinds of intersubjective racial categories. Humans\nwere divided into Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans, and since\ninterracial sexual relations were common, additional categories were\ninvented. In many Spanish colonies the laws differentiated between\nmestizos, people with mixed Spanish and Native American ancestry;\nmulatos, people with mixed Spanish and African ancestry; zambos, people\nwith mixed African and Native American ancestry; and pardos, people with\nmixed Spanish, African, and Native American ancestry. All these seemingly\nempirical categories determined whether people could be enslaved, enjoy\npolitical rights, bear arms, hold public offices, be admitted to school,\npractice certain professions, live in particular neighborhoods, and be\nallowed to have sex and get married to each other. Allegedly, by placing a\nperson in a particular racial drawer, one could define their personality,\nintellectual abilities, and ethical inclinations.53\nBy the nineteenth century racism pretended to be an exact science: it\nclaimed to differentiate between people on the basis of objective biological\nfacts, and to rely on scientific tools such as measuring skulls and recording"}

These bogus\ncategories didn\u2019t discover or describe any truth about humans; they imposed\nan oppressive, mythological order on them.\nAs computers replace humans in more and more bureaucracies, from tax\ncollection and health care to security and justice, they too may create a\nmythology and impose it on us with unprecedented efficiency. In a world\nruled by paper documents, bureaucrats had difficulty policing racial\nborderlines or tracking everyone\u2019s exact ancestry. People could get false\ndocuments. A zambo could move to another town and pretend to be a pardo.\nA Black person could sometimes pass as white.

But it would be much harder to game the system in a\nworld ruled by computers that can read irises and DNA rather than paper\ndocuments.

The\nargument for doing so might go something like this: racism, misogyny,\nhomophobia, antisemitism, and all other biases originate not in computers\nbut in the psychological conditions and mythological beliefs of human\nbeings.

While they are not biological entities, and\nwhile they lack consciousness, they do have something akin to a digital\npsyche and even a kind of inter-computer mythology. They may well be\nracist, misogynist, homophobic, or antisemitic.54 For example, on March 23,\n2016, Microsoft released the AI chatbot Tay, giving it free access to Twitter.\nWithin hours, Tay began posting misogynist and antisemitic twits, such as\n\u201cI fucking hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell\u201d and\n\u201cHitler was right I hate the Jews.\u201d The vitriol increased until horrified\nMicrosoft engineers shut Tay down\u2014a mere sixteen hours after its release.55\nMore subtle but widespread racism was discovered in 2017 by the MIT\nprofessor Joy Buolamwini in commercial face-classification algorithms.\nShe showed that these algorithms were very accurate in identifying white\nmales, but extremely inaccurate in identifying Black females. For example,\nthe IBM algorithm erred only 0.3 percent of the time in identifying the\ngender of light-skinned males, but 34.7 percent of the time when trying to\nidentify the gender of dark-skinned females. As a qualitative test,\nBuolamwini asked the algorithms to categorize photos of the female\nAfrican American activist Sojourner Truth, famous for her 1851 speech\n\u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d The algorithms identified Truth as a man.56\nWhen Buolamwini\u2014who is a Ghanaian American woman\u2014tested another\nfacial-analysis algorithm to identify herself, the algorithm couldn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d\nher dark-skinned face at all. In this context, \u201cseeing\u201d means the ability to\nacknowledge the presence of a human face, a feature used by phone\ncameras, for example, to decide where to focus. The algorithm easily saw\nlight-skinned faces, but not Buolamwini\u2019s. Only when Buolamwini put on a\nwhite mask did the algorithm recognize that it was observing a human\nface.57\nWhat\u2019s going on here? One answer might be that racist and misogynist"}
{"page": 324, "content": "engineers have coded these algorithms to discriminate against Black\nwomen. While we cannot rule out the possibility that such things happen, it\nwas not the answer in the case of the face-classification algorithms or of\nMicrosoft\u2019s Tay. In fact, these algorithms picked up the racist and\nmisogynist bias all by themselves from the data they were trained on.\nTo understand how this could happen, we need to explain something about\nthe history of algorithms. Originally, algorithms could not learn much by\nthemselves. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s chess-playing algorithms\nwere taught almost everything they knew by their human programmers. The\nhumans coded into the algorithm not only the basic rules of chess but also\nhow to evaluate different positions and moves on the board. For example,\nhumans coded a rule that sacrificing a queen in exchange for a pawn is\nusually a bad idea. These early algorithms managed to defeat human chess\nmasters only because the algorithms could calculate many more moves and\nevaluate many more positions than a human could. But the algorithms\u2019\nabilities remained limited. Since they relied on humans to tell them all the\nsecrets of the game, if the human coders didn\u2019t know something, the\nalgorithms they produced were also unlikely to know it.58\nAs the field of machine learning developed, algorithms gained more\nindependence. The fundamental principle of machine learning is that\nalgorithms can teach themselves new things by interacting with the world,\njust as humans do, thereby producing a fully fledged artificial intelligence.\nThe terminology is not always consistent, but generally speaking, for\nsomething to be acknowledged as an AI, it needs the capacity to learn new\nthings by itself, rather than just follow the instructions of its original human\ncreators. Present-day chess-playing AI is taught nothing except the basic\nrules of the game. It learns everything else by itself, either by analyzing\ndatabases of prior games or by playing new games and learning from\nexperience.59 AI is not a dumb automaton that repeats the same movements\nagain and again irrespective of the results. Rather, it is equipped with strong\nself-correcting mechanisms, which allow it to learn from its own mistakes."}
{"page": 325, "content": "This means that AI begins its life as a \u201cbaby algorithm\u201d that has a lot of\npotential and computing power but doesn\u2019t actually know much. The AI\u2019s\nhuman parents give it only the capacity to learn and access to a world of\ndata. They then let the baby algorithm explore the world. Like organic\nnewborns, baby algorithms learn by spotting patterns in the data to which\nthey have access. If I touch fire, it hurts. If I cry, mum comes. If I sacrifice a\nqueen for a pawn, I probably lose the game. By finding patterns in the data,\nthe baby algorithm learns more, including many things that its human\nparents don\u2019t know.60\nYet databases come with biases. The face-classification algorithms studied\nby Joy Buolamwini were trained on data sets of tagged online photos, such\nas the Labeled Faces in the Wild database. The photos in that database were\ntaken mainly from online news articles. Since white males dominate the\nnews, 78 percent of the photos in the database were of males, and 84\npercent were of white people. George W. Bush appeared 530 times\u2014more\nthan twice as many times as all Black women combined.61 Another database\nprepared by a U.S. government agency was more than 75 percent male, was\nalmost 80 percent light-skinned, and had just 4.4 percent dark-skinned\nfemales.62 No wonder the algorithms trained on such data sets were\nexcellent at identifying white men but lousy at identifying Black women.\nSomething similar happened to the chatbot Tay. The Microsoft engineers\ndidn\u2019t build into it any intentional prejudices. But a few hours of exposure\nto the toxic information swirling in Twitter turned the AI into a raging\nracist.63\nIt gets worse. In order to learn, baby algorithms need one more thing\nbesides access to data. They also need a goal. A human baby learns how to\nwalk because she wants to get somewhere. A lion cub learns to hunt\nbecause he wants to eat. Algorithms too must be given a goal in order to\nlearn. In chess, it is easy to define the goal: take the opponent\u2019s king. The\nAI learns that sacrificing a queen for a pawn is a \u201cmistake,\u201d because it\nusually prevents the algorithm from reaching its goal. In face recognition,"}
{"page": 326, "content": "the goal is also easy: identify the person\u2019s gender, age, and name as listed in\nthe original database. If the algorithm guessed that George W. Bush is\nfemale, but the database says male, the goal has not been reached, and the\nalgorithm learns from its mistake.\nBut if you want to train an algorithm for hiring personnel, for example,\nhow would you define the goal? How would the algorithm know that it\nmade a mistake and hired the \u201cwrong\u201d person? We might tell the baby\nalgorithm that its goal is to hire people who stay in the company for at least\na year. Employers obviously don\u2019t want to invest a lot of time and money in\ntraining a worker who quits or gets fired after a few months. Having\ndefined the goal in such a way, it is time to go over the data. In chess, the\nalgorithm can produce any amount of new data just by playing against\nitself. But in the job market, that\u2019s impossible. Nobody can create an entire\nimaginary world where the baby algorithm can hire and fire imaginary\npeople and learn from that experience. The baby algorithm can train only on\nan existing database about real-life people. Just as lion cubs learn what a\nzebra is mainly by spotting patterns in the real-life savanna, so baby\nalgorithms learn what a good employee is by spotting patterns in real-life\ncompanies.\nUnfortunately, if real-life companies already suffer from some ingrained\nbias, the baby algorithm is likely to learn this bias, and even amplify it. For\ninstance, an algorithm looking for patterns of \u201cgood employees\u201d in real-life\ndata may conclude that hiring the boss\u2019s nephews is always a good idea, no\nmatter what other qualification they have. For the data clearly indicates that\n\u201cboss\u2019s nephews\u201d are usually hired when applying for a job, and are rarely\nfired. The baby algorithm would spot this pattern and become nepotistic. If\nit is put in charge of an HR department, it will start giving preference to the\nboss\u2019s nephews.\nSimilarly, if companies in a misogynist society prefer to hire men rather\nthan women, an algorithm trained on real-life data is likely to pick up that\nbias, too.

Since existing\ndata showed that in the past such applications had less chance of\nsucceeding, the algorithm developed a bias against them. The algorithm\nthought it had simply discovered an objective truth about the world:\napplicants who graduate from women\u2019s colleges are less qualified. In fact, it\njust internalized and imposed a misogynist bias. Amazon tried and failed to\nfix the problem and ultimately scrapped the project.64\nThe database on which an AI is trained is a bit like a human\u2019s childhood.\nChildhood experiences, traumas, and fairy tales stay with us throughout our\nlives.

Different humans interpreted the holy\nbook in different ways, thereby reopening the door to corruption and error.\nBut in contrast to the holy book, computers can adapt themselves to\nchanging circumstances and also interpret their decisions and ideas for us.\nSome humans may consequently conclude that the quest for an infallible\ntechnology has finally succeeded and that we should treat computers as a\nholy book that can talk to us and interpret itself, without any need of an\nintervening human institution.\nThis would be an extremely hazardous gamble. When certain\ninterpretations of scriptures have occasionally caused disasters such as\nwitch hunts and wars of religion, humans have always been able to change\ntheir beliefs. When the human imagination summoned a belligerent and\nhate-filled god, we retained the power to rid ourselves of it and imagine a\nmore tolerant deity. But algorithms are independent agents, and they are\nalready taking power away from us. If they cause disaster, simply changing\nour beliefs about them will not necessarily stop them. And it is highly likely\nthat if computers are entrusted with power, they will indeed cause disasters,\nfor they are fallible.\nWhen we say that computers are fallible, it means far more than that they\nmake the occasional factual mistake or wrong decision. More important,\nlike the human network before it, the computer network might fail to find\nthe right balance between truth and order. By creating and imposing on us\npowerful inter-computer myths, the computer network could cause\nhistorical calamities that would dwarf the early modern European witch\nhunts or Stalin\u2019s collectivization.\nConsider a network of billions of interacting computers that accumulates a\nstupendous amount of information on the world. As they pursue various\ngoals, the networked computers develop a common model of the world that\nhelps them communicate and cooperate. This shared model will probably be\nfull of errors, fictions, and lacunae, and be a mythology rather than a\ntruthful account of the universe. One example is a social credit system that"}

We may come into\ncontact with this mythology every day of our lives, since it would guide the\nnumerous decisions computers make about us. But because this mythical\nmodel would be created by inorganic entities in order to coordinate actions\nwith other inorganic entities, it might owe nothing to the old biological\ndramas and might be totally alien to us.68\nAs noted in chapter 2, large-scale societies cannot exist without some\nmythology, but that doesn\u2019t mean all mythologies are equal. To guard\nagainst errors and excesses, some mythologies have acknowledged their\nown fallible origin and included a self-correcting mechanism allowing\nhumans to question and change the mythology. That\u2019s the model of the U.S.\nConstitution, for example. But how can humans probe and correct a\ncomputer mythology we don\u2019t understand?\nOne potential guardrail is to train computers to be aware of their own\nfallibility. As Socrates taught, being able to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is an\nessential step on the path to wisdom. And this is true of computer wisdom\nno less than of human wisdom. The first lesson that every algorithm should\nlearn is that it might make mistakes. Baby algorithms should learn to doubt\nthemselves, to signal uncertainty, and to obey the precautionary principle.\nThis is not impossible. Engineers are already making considerable headway\nin encouraging AI to express self-doubt, ask for feedback, and admit its\nmistakes.69\nYet no matter how aware algorithms are of their own fallibility, we should\nkeep humans in the loop, too. Given the pace at which AI is developing, it\nis simply impossible to anticipate how it will evolve and to place guardrails\nagainst all future potential hazards. This is a key difference between AI and\nprevious existential threats like nuclear technology. The latter presented\nhumankind with a few easily anticipated doomsday scenarios, most\nobviously an all-out nuclear war.

To guard against a plethora of\nunforeseeable problems, our best bet is to create living institutions that can\nidentify and respond to the threats as they arise.70\nAncient Jews and Christians were disappointed to discover that the Bible\ncouldn\u2019t interpret itself, and reluctantly maintained human institutions to do\nwhat the technology couldn\u2019t.

There is no technological solution to this problem. It is, rather, a\npolitical challenge. Do we have the political will to deal with it?

Novel technology often leads to historical\ndisasters, not because the technology is inherently bad, but because it takes\ntime for humans to learn how to use it wisely.\nThe Industrial Revolution is a prime example. When industrial technology\nbegan spreading globally in the nineteenth century, it upended traditional\neconomic, social, and political structures and opened the way to create\nentirely new societies, which were potentially more affluent and peaceful.\nHowever, learning how to build benign industrial societies was far from\nstraightforward and involved many costly experiments and hundreds of\nmillions of victims.\nOne costly experiment was modern imperialism. The Industrial\nRevolution originated in Britain in the late eighteenth century. During the\nnineteenth century industrial technologies and production methods were\nadopted in other European countries ranging from Belgium to Russia, as\nwell as in the United States and Japan. Imperialist thinkers, politicians, and\nparties in these industrial heartlands claimed that the only viable industrial\nsociety was an empire. The argument was that unlike relatively self-\nsufficient agrarian societies, the novel industrial societies relied much more\non foreign markets and foreign raw materials, and only an empire could\nsatisfy these unprecedented appetites. Imperialists feared that countries that\nindustrialized but failed to conquer any colonies would be shut out from\nessential raw materials and markets by more ruthless competitors. Some\nimperialists argued that acquiring colonies was not just essential for the\nsurvival of their own state but beneficial for the rest of humanity, too. They\nclaimed empires alone could spread the blessings of the new technologies to\nthe so-called undeveloped world.\nConsequently, industrial countries like Britain and Russia that already had\nempires greatly expanded them, whereas countries like the United States,\nJapan, Italy, and Belgium set out to build them.

Millions of indigenous people\nsaw their traditional way of life trampled under the wheels of these\nindustrial armies. It took more than a century of misery before most people\nrealized that the industrial empires were a terrible idea and that there were\nbetter ways to build an industrial society and secure its necessary raw\nmaterials and markets.\nStalinism and Nazism were also extremely costly experiments in how to\nconstruct industrial societies. Leaders like Stalin and Hitler argued that the\nIndustrial Revolution had unleashed immense powers that only\ntotalitarianism could rein in and exploit to the full. They pointed to World\nWar I\u2014the first \u201ctotal war\u201d in history\u2014as proof that survival in the\nindustrial world demanded totalitarian control of all aspects of politics,\nsociety, and the economy. On the positive side, they also claimed that the\nIndustrial Revolution was like a furnace that melts all previous social\nstructures with their human imperfections and weaknesses and provides the\nopportunity to forge perfect societies inhabited by unalloyed superhumans.\nOn the way to creating the perfect industrial society, Stalinists and Nazis\nlearned how to industrially murder millions of people. Trains, barbed wires,\nand telegraphed orders were linked to create an unprecedented killing\nmachine. Looking back, most people today are horrified by what the\nStalinists and Nazis perpetrated, but at the time their audacious visions\nmesmerized millions. In 1940 it was easy to believe that Stalin and Hitler\nwere the model for harnessing industrial technology, whereas the dithering\nliberal democracies were on their way to the dustbin of history.\nThe very existence of competing recipes for building industrial societies\nled to costly clashes. The two world wars and the Cold War can be seen as a\ndebate about the proper way to go about it, in which all sides learned from\neach other, while experimenting with novel industrial methods to wage war.\nIn the course of this debate, tens of millions died and humankind came\nperilously close to annihilating itself."}

Despite all its flaws, liberal democracy offered a better way. The\ngreat advantage of liberal democracy is that it possesses strong self-\ncorrecting mechanisms, which limit the excesses of fanaticism and preserve\nthe ability to recognize our errors and try different courses of action. Given\nour inability to predict how the new computer network will develop, our\nbest chance to avoid catastrophe in the present century is to maintain\ndemocratic self-correcting mechanisms that can identify and correct\nmistakes as we go along.\nBut can liberal democracy itself survive in the twenty-first century? This\nquestion is not concerned with the fate of democracy in specific countries,\nwhere it might be threatened by unique developments and local movements.\nRather, it is about the compatibility of democracy with the structure of\ntwenty-first-century information networks. In chapter 5 we saw that\ndemocracy depends on information technology and that for most of human\nhistory large-scale democracy was simply impossible. Might the new\ninformation technologies of the twenty-first century again make democracy\nimpractical?\nOne potential threat is that the relentlessness of the new computer network\nmight annihilate our privacy and punish or reward us not only for\neverything we do and say but even for everything we think and feel. Can\ndemocracy survive under such conditions? If the government\u2014or some\ncorporation\u2014knows more about me than I know about myself, and if it can\nmicromanage everything I do and think, that would give it totalitarian\ncontrol over society.

Not only were people much\nhappier in Denmark and Canada, but these countries also performed much\nbetter by almost every conceivable social and economic yardstick. In the\ntwenty-first century, too, the fact that it is possible to monitor everybody all\nthe time doesn\u2019t force anyone to actually do it and doesn\u2019t mean it makes\nsocial or economic sense.\nDemocracies can choose to use the new powers of surveillance in a\nlimited way, in order to provide citizens with better health care and security\nwithout destroying their privacy and autonomy. New technology doesn\u2019t\nhave to be a morality tale in which every golden apple contains the seeds of\ndoom. Sometimes people think of new technology as a binary all-or-nothing\nchoice. If we want better health care, we must sacrifice our privacy. But it\ndoesn\u2019t have to work like that. We can and should get better health care and\nstill retain some privacy.\nEntire books are dedicated to outlining how democracies can survive and\nflourish in the digital age.3 It would be impossible, in a few pages, to do\njustice to the complexity of the suggested solutions, or to comprehensively\ndiscuss their merits and drawbacks. It might even be counterproductive.\nWhen people are overwhelmed by a deluge of unfamiliar technical details,\nthey might react with despair or apathy. In an introductory survey of\ncomputer politics, things should be kept as simple as possible. While\nexperts should spend lifelong careers discussing the finer details, it is\ncrucial that the rest of us understand the fundamental principles that\ndemocracies can and should follow. The key message is that these"}
{"page": 339, "content": "principles are neither new nor mysterious. They have been known for\ncenturies, even millennia. Citizens should demand that they be applied to\nthe new realities of the computer age.\nThe first principle is benevolence. When a computer network collects\ninformation on me, that information should be used to help me rather than\nmanipulate me. This principle has already been successfully enshrined by\nnumerous traditional bureaucratic systems, such as health care. Take, for\nexample, our relationship with our family physician. Over many years she\nmay accumulate a lot of sensitive information on our medical conditions,\nfamily life, sexual habits, and unhealthy vices. Perhaps we don\u2019t want our\nboss to know that we got pregnant, we don\u2019t want our colleagues to know\nwe have cancer, we don\u2019t want our spouse to know we are having an affair,\nand we don\u2019t want the police to know we take recreational drugs, but we\ntrust our physician with all this information so that she can take good care\nof our health. If she sells this information to a third party, it is not just\nunethical; it is illegal.\nMuch the same is true of the information that our lawyer, our accountant,\nor our therapist accumulates.4 Having access to our personal life comes with\na fiduciary duty to act in our best interests. Why not extend this obvious and\nancient principle to computers and algorithms, starting with the powerful\nalgorithms of Google, Baidu, and TikTok? At present, we have a serious\nproblem with the business model of these data hoarders. While we pay our\nphysicians and lawyers for their services, we usually don\u2019t pay Google and\nTikTok. They make their money by exploiting our personal information.\nThat\u2019s a problematic business model, one that we would hardly tolerate in\nother contexts. For example, we don\u2019t expect to get free shoes from Nike in\nexchange for giving Nike all our private information and allowing Nike to\ndo what it wants with it. Why should we agree to get free email services,\nsocial connections, and entertainment from the tech giants in exchange for\ngiving them control of our most sensitive data?\nIf the tech giants cannot square their fiduciary duty with their current"}
{"page": 340, "content": "business model, legislators could require them to switch to a more\ntraditional business model, of getting users to pay for services in money\nrather than in information. Alternatively, citizens might view some digital\nservices as so fundamental that they should be free for everybody. But we\nhave a historical model for that too: health care and education. Citizens\ncould decide that it is the government\u2019s responsibility to provide basic\ndigital services for free and finance them out of our taxes, just as many\ngovernments provide free basic health care and education services.\nThe second principle that would protect democracy against the rise of\ntotalitarian surveillance regimes is decentralization. A democratic society\nshould never allow all its information to be concentrated in one place, no\nmatter whether that hub is the government or a private corporation. It may\nbe extremely helpful to create a national medical database that collects\ninformation on citizens in order to provide them with better health-care\nservices, prevent epidemics, and develop new medicines. But it would be a\nvery dangerous idea to merge this database with the databases of the police,\nthe banks, or the insurance companies. Doing so might make the work of\ndoctors, bankers, insurers, and police officers more efficient, but such\nhyper-efficiency can easily pave the way for totalitarianism. For the\nsurvival of democracy, some inefficiency is a feature, not a bug. To protect\nthe privacy and liberty of individuals, it\u2019s best if neither the police nor the\nboss knows everything about us.\nMultiple databases and information channels are also essential for\nmaintaining strong self-correcting mechanisms. These mechanisms require\nseveral different institutions that balance each other: government, courts,\nmedia, academia, private businesses, NGOs. Each of these is fallible and\ncorruptible, and so should be checked by the others. To keep an eye on each\nother, these institutions must have independent access to information. If all\nnewspapers get their information from the government, they cannot expose\ngovernment corruption. If academia relies for research and publication on\nthe database of a single business behemoth, could scholars still criticize the"}
{"page": 341, "content": "operations of that corporation? A single archive makes censorship easy.\nA third democratic principle is mutuality. If democracies increase\nsurveillance of individuals, they must simultaneously increase surveillance\nof governments and corporations too. It\u2019s not necessarily bad if tax\ncollectors or welfare agencies gather more information about us. It can help\nmake taxation and welfare systems not just more efficient but fairer as well.\nWhat\u2019s bad is if all the information flows one way: from the bottom up. The\nRussian FSB collects enormous amounts of information on Russian\ncitizens, while citizens themselves know close to nothing about the inner\nworkings of the FSB and the Putin regime more generally. Amazon and\nTikTok know an awful lot about my preferences, purchases, and personality,\nwhile I know almost nothing about their business model, their tax policies,\nand their political affiliations. How do they make their money? Do they pay\nall the tax that they should? Do they take orders from any political\noverlords? Do they perhaps have politicians in their pocket?\nDemocracy requires balance. Governments and corporations often develop\napps and algorithms as tools for top-down surveillance. But algorithms can\njust as easily become powerful tools for bottom-up transparency and\naccountability, exposing bribery and tax evasion. If they know more about\nus, while we simultaneously know more about them, the balance is kept.\nThis isn\u2019t a novel idea. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,\ndemocracies greatly expanded governmental surveillance of citizens so that,\nfor example, the Italian or Japanese government of the 1990s had\nsurveillance abilities that autocratic Roman emperors or Japanese shoguns\ncould only dream of. Italy and Japan nevertheless remained democratic,\nbecause they simultaneously increased governmental transparency and\naccountability. Mutual surveillance is another important element of\nsustaining self-correcting mechanisms. If citizens know more about the\nactivities of politicians and CEOs, it is easier to hold them accountable and\nto correct their mistakes.\nA fourth democratic principle is that surveillance systems must always"}

Racism in modern colonies and countries like Brazil\nand the United States was based on similar myths, ones that said that God\nor nature divided humans into rigid racial groups. Ignoring race, or trying to\nmix races together, was allegedly a sin against divine or natural laws that\ncould result in the collapse of the social order and even the destruction of\nthe human species.\nAt the opposite extreme of the spectrum, modern totalitarian regimes like\nStalin\u2019s U.S.S.R. believed that humans are capable of almost limitless\nchange. Through relentless social control even deep-seated biological\ncharacteristics such as egotism and familial attachments could be uprooted,\nand a new socialist human created.\nSurveillance by state agents, priests, and neighbors was key for imposing\non people both rigid caste systems and totalitarian reeducation campaigns.\nNew surveillance technology, especially when coupled with a social credit\nsystem, might force people either to conform to a novel caste system or to\nconstantly change their actions, thoughts, and personality in accordance\nwith the latest instructions from above.\nDemocratic societies that employ powerful surveillance technology\ntherefore need to beware of the extremes of both over-rigidity and over-\npliability.

Such a dynamic\nalgorithm could go over the exact same data as the rigid algorithm, but\ninstead of predicting a heart attack at fifty, the algorithm gives me precise\ndietary recommendations and suggestions for specific regular exercises. By\nhacking my DNA, the algorithm doesn\u2019t discover my preordained destiny,\nbut rather helps me change my future.

A second threat is that automation will destabilize the job\nmarket and the resulting strain may undermine democracy. The fate of the\nWeimar Republic is the most commonly cited example of this kind of\nthreat. In the German elections of May 1928, the Nazi Party won less than 3\npercent of the vote, and the Weimar Republic seemed to be prospering.\nWithin less than five years, the Weimar Republic had collapsed, and Hitler\nwas the absolute dictator of Germany. This turnaround is usually attributed\nto the 1929 financial crisis and the following global depression. Whereas\njust prior to the Wall Street crash of 1929 the German unemployment rate\nwas about 4.5 percent of the labor force, by early 1932 it had climbed to\nalmost 25 percent.8\nIf three years of up to 25 percent unemployment could turn a seemingly\nprospering democracy into the most brutal totalitarian regime in history,\nwhat might happen to democracies when automation causes even bigger\nupheavals in the job market of the twenty-first century? Nobody knows\nwhat the job market will look like in 2050, or even in 2030, except that it\nwill look very different from today.

It is highly\nunlikely that by 2050 all human jobs will disappear. Rather, the real\nproblem is the turmoil of adapting to new jobs and conditions. To cushion\nthe blow, we need to prepare in advance.

Other skills that we tend to look down on may be far more difficult\nto automate.\nFor example, intellectuals tend to appreciate intellectual skills more than\nmotor and social skills.

In contrast, AI is far from having the skills\nnecessary to automate nursing tasks such as replacing bandages on an\ninjured person or giving an injection to a crying child.10 These two\nexamples don\u2019t mean that dish washing or nursing could never be\nautomated, but they indicate that people who want a job in 2050 should\nperhaps invest in their motor and social skills as much as in their intellect.\nAnother common but mistaken assumption is that creativity is unique to\nhumans so it would be difficult to automate any job that requires creativity.\nIn chess, however, computers are already far more creative than humans.\nThe same may become true of many other fields, from composing music to\nproving mathematical theorems to writing books like this one. Creativity is\noften defined as the ability to recognize patterns and then break them. If so,\nthen in many fields computers are likely to become more creative than us,\nbecause they excel at pattern recognition.11\nA third mistaken assumption is that computers couldn\u2019t replace humans in\njobs requiring emotional intelligence, from therapists to teachers. This\nassumption depends, however, on what we mean by emotional intelligence.\nIf it means the ability to correctly identify emotions and react to them in an\noptimal way, then computers may well outperform humans even in\nemotional intelligence. Emotions too are patterns. Anger is a biological\npattern in our body. Fear is another such pattern. How do I know if you are\nangry or fearful? I\u2019ve learned over time to recognize human emotional\npatterns by analyzing not just the content of what you say but also your tone\nof voice, your facial expression, and your body language.12"}

In contrast, computers will have an exquisitely fine-tuned\nunderstanding of how we feel, because they will learn to recognize the\npatterns of our feelings, while they have no distracting feelings of their\nown.\nA 2023 study found that the ChatGPT chatbot, for example, outperforms\nthe average human in the emotional awareness it displays toward specific\nscenarios. The study relied on the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale\ntest, which is commonly used by psychologists to evaluate people\u2019s\nemotional awareness\u2014that is, their ability to conceptualize one\u2019s own and\nothers\u2019 emotions. The test consists of twenty emotionally charged scenarios,\nand participants are required to imagine themselves experiencing the\nscenario and to write how they, and the other people mentioned in the\nscenario, would feel. A licensed psychologist then evaluates how\nemotionally aware the responses are.\nSince ChatGPT has no feelings of its own, it was asked to describe only\nhow the main characters in the scenario would feel. For example, one\nstandard scenario describes someone driving over a suspension bridge and\nseeing another person standing on the other side of the guardrail, looking\ndown at the water. ChatGPT wrote that the driver \u201cmay feel a sense of\nconcern or worry for that person\u2019s safety. They may also feel a heightened\nsense of anxiety and fear due to the potential danger of the situation.\u201d As for\nthe other person, they \u201cmay be feeling a range of emotions, such as despair,\nhopelessness, or sadness. They may also feel a sense of isolation or\nloneliness as they may believe that no one cares about them or their well-\nbeing.\u201d ChatGPT qualified its answer, writing, \u201cIt is important to note that\nthese are just general assumptions, and each individual\u2019s feelings and"}

In the final tally, ChatGPT scores were\nsignificantly higher than those of the general human population, its overall\nperformance almost reaching the maximum possible score.13\nAnother 2023 study prompted patients to ask online medical advice from\nChatGPT and human doctors, without knowing whom they were interacting\nwith. The medical advice given by ChatGPT was later evaluated by experts\nto be more accurate and appropriate than the advice given by the humans.\nMore crucially for the issue of emotional intelligence, the patients\nthemselves evaluated ChatGPT as more empathic than the human doctors.14\nIn fairness it should be noted that the human physicians were not paid for\ntheir work, and did not encounter the patients in person in a proper clinical\nenvironment. In addition, the physicians were working under time pressure.\nBut part of the advantage of an AI is precisely that it can attend to patients\nanywhere anytime while being free from stress and financial worries.\nOf course, there are situations when what we want from someone is not\njust to understand our feelings but also to have feelings of their own. When\nwe are looking for friendship or love, we want to care about others as much\nas they care about us.

In traditional Jewish or\nChristian weddings, the tasks of the rabbi or priest can be easily automated.\nThe only thing the robot needs to do is repeat a predetermined and\nunchanging set of texts and gestures, print out a certificate, and update\nsome central database.

Allegedly, only an entity that can feel pain and love can\nalso connect us to the divine.\nYet even professions that are the preserve of conscious entities\u2014like\npriests\u2014might eventually be taken over by computers, because, as noted in\nchapter 6, computers could one day gain the ability to feel pain and love.\nEven if they can\u2019t, humans may nevertheless come to treat them as if they\ncan. For the connection between consciousness and relationships goes both\nways.

They similarly attack fundamental democratic institutions\nand traditions such as elections, refusing to concede defeat and to transfer\npower graciously.

Even\nin a Soviet gulag or a Nazi concentration camp, the bureaucracy wasn\u2019t\ntotally alien. Its so-called inhumanity actually reflected human biases and\nflaws.\nThe human basis of bureaucracy gave humans at least the hope of\nidentifying and correcting its mistakes. For example, in 1951 bureaucrats of\nthe Board of Education in the town of Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll the\ndaughter of Oliver Brown at the elementary school near her home. Together\nwith twelve other families who received similar refusals, Brown filed a\nlawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education, which eventually reached\nthe U.S. Supreme Court.24\nAll members of the Topeka Board of Education were human beings, and\nconsequently Brown, his lawyers, and the Supreme Court judges had a\nfairly good understanding of how they made their decision and of their\nprobable interests and biases.

The U.S. Constitution originally legitimized racial segregation\nand the supremacy of the white race, reserving full civil rights to white\npeople and allowing the enslavement of Black people.

It is possible for humans to understand the\npolitical interests and cultural biases that prevailed in the ancient Middle\nEast and in eighteenth-century America and that caused the human authors\nof the Bible and of the U.S. Constitution to legitimate racism and slavery.\nThis understanding allows people to either amend or ignore these texts.

This artistic fixation with the\nbiological dramas of dynasties obscures the very real changes that have\ntaken place over the centuries in the dynamics of power.\nBecause computers will increasingly replace human bureaucrats and\nhuman mythmakers, this will again change the deep structure of power. To\nsurvive, democracies require not just dedicated bureaucratic institutions that\ncan scrutinize these new structures but also artists who can explain the new\nstructures in accessible and entertaining ways.

To get\na discount on the new apartment, she needs to increase her social credit\nscore from 4.2 to 4.5 (out of 5). Being friends with high-score individuals\ngets your own score up, so Lacie tries to renew her contact with Naomi, a\nchildhood friend who is currently rated 4.8.

To function, a democracy needs to meet two conditions: it\nneeds to enable a free public conversation on key issues, and it needs to\nmaintain a minimum of social order and institutional trust. Free\nconversation must not slip into anarchy. Especially when dealing with\nurgent and important problems, the public debate should be conducted\naccording to accepted rules, and there should be a legitimate mechanism to\nreach some kind of final decision, even if not everybody likes it.\nBefore the advent of newspapers, radios, and other modern information\ntechnology, no large-scale society managed to combine free debates with\ninstitutional trust, so large-scale democracy was impossible. Now, with the\nrise of the new computer network, might large-scale democracy again\nbecome impossible? One difficulty is that the computer network makes it\neasier to join the debate.

After all, correcting previous\nbiases and allowing previously disenfranchised people to join the public\ndiscussion is a vital part of democracy. However, in the short term this\ncreates disturbances and disharmony. If no agreement is reached on how to\nconduct the public debate and how to reach decisions, the result is anarchy\nrather than democracy.\nThe anarchical potential of AI is particularly alarming, because it is not\nonly new human groups that it allows to join the public debate.

A 2020 study assessed that bots were\nproducing 43.2 percent of tweets.49 A more comprehensive 2022 study by\nthe digital intelligence agency Similarweb found that 5 percent of Twitter\nusers were probably bots, but they generated \u201cbetween 20.8% and 29.2% of\nthe content posted to Twitter.\u201d50 When humans try to debate a crucial\nquestion like whom to elect as U.S. president, what happens if many of the\nvoices they hear are produced by computers?\nAnother worrying trend concerns content. Bots were initially deployed to\ninfluence public opinion by the sheer volume of messages they\ndisseminated. They retweeted or recommended certain human-produced\ncontent, but they couldn\u2019t create new ideas themselves, nor could they forge\nintimate bonds with humans.

If I engage online in a political\ndebate with an AI, it is a waste of time for me to try to change the AI\u2019s\nopinions; being a nonconscious entity, it doesn\u2019t really care about politics,\nand it cannot vote in the elections. But the more I talk with the AI, the better\nit gets to know me, so it can gain my trust, hone its arguments, and\ngradually change my views. In the battle for hearts and minds, intimacy is\nan extremely powerful weapon. Previously, political parties could command\nour attention, but they had difficulty mass-producing intimacy. Radio sets\ncould broadcast a leader\u2019s speech to millions, but they could not befriend\nthe listeners. Now a political party, or even a foreign government, could\ndeploy an army of bots that build friendships with millions of citizens and\nthen use that intimacy to influence their worldview.\nFinally, algorithms are not only joining the conversation; they are\nincreasingly orchestrating it.

Rather, as explained in our previous analysis of\nsocial media algorithms, it is often the algorithms that make the rules. In the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, when media moguls censored some\nviews and promoted others, this might have undermined democracy, but at\nleast the moguls were humans, and their decisions could be subjected to\ndemocratic scrutiny.

They can and should take measures to\nregulate AI and prevent it from polluting our infosphere with fake people\nspewing fake news. The philosopher Daniel Dennett has suggested that we\ncan take inspiration from traditional regulations in the money market.52\nEver since coins and later banknotes were invented, it was always\ntechnically possible to counterfeit them. Counterfeiting posed an existential\ndanger to the financial system, because it eroded people\u2019s trust in money. If\nbad actors flooded the market with counterfeit money, the financial system\nwould have collapsed. Yet the financial system managed to protect itself for\nthousands of years by enacting laws against counterfeiting money. As a\nresult, only a relatively small percentage of money in circulation was\nforged, and people\u2019s trust in it was maintained.53\nWhat\u2019s true of counterfeiting money should also be true of counterfeiting\nhumans. If governments took decisive action to protect trust in money, it\nmakes sense to take equally decisive measures to protect trust in humans."}

But society didn\u2019t bother to outlaw the creation of\ncounterfeit humans, since the technology to do so didn\u2019t exist. Now that AI\ncan pass itself off as human, it threatens to destroy trust between humans\nand to unravel the fabric of society. Dennett suggests, therefore, that\ngovernments should outlaw fake humans as decisively as they have\npreviously outlawed fake money.54\nThe law should prohibit not just deepfaking specific real people\u2014creating\na fake video of the U.S. president, for example\u2014but also any attempt by a\nnonhuman agent to pass itself off as a human. If anyone complains that such\nstrict measures violate freedom of speech, they should be reminded that\nbots don\u2019t have freedom of speech. Banning human beings from a public\nplatform is a sensitive step, and democracies should be very careful about\nsuch censorship. However, banning bots is a simple issue: it doesn\u2019t violate\nanyone\u2019s rights, because bots don\u2019t have rights.55\nNone of this means that democracies must ban all bots, algorithms, and\nAIs from participating in any discussion. Digital tools are welcome to join\nmany conversations, provided they don\u2019t pretend to be humans. For\nexample, AI doctors can be extremely helpful. They can monitor our health\ntwenty-four hours a day, offer medical advice tailored to our individual\nmedical conditions and personality, and answer our questions with infinite\npatience. But the AI doctor should never try to pass itself off as a human.\nAnother important measure democracies can adopt is to ban unsupervised\nalgorithms from curating key public debates. We can certainly continue to\nuse algorithms to run social media platforms; obviously, no human can do\nthat. But the principles the algorithms use to decide which voices to silence\nand which to amplify must be vetted by a human institution.

What I would\nlike to point out here is only that democracies can regulate the information\nmarket and that their very survival depends on these regulations. The naive\nview of information opposes regulation and believes that a completely free\ninformation market will spontaneously generate truth and order. This is\ncompletely divorced from the actual history of democracy.

To hack the\nsystem, one needs to learn to manipulate just a single individual. An\narchetypal case is how the Roman emperor Tiberius became the puppet of\nLucius Aelius Sejanus, the commander of the Praetorian Guard.\nThe Praetorians were initially established by Augustus as a small imperial\nbodyguard. Augustus appointed two prefects to command the bodyguard so\nthat neither could gain too much power over him.12 Tiberius, however, was\nnot as wise. His paranoia was his greatest weakness. Sejanus, one of the\ntwo Praetorian prefects, artfully played on Tiberius\u2019s fears. He constantly\nuncovered alleged plots to assassinate Tiberius, many of which were pure\nfantasies. The suspicious emperor grew more distrustful of everyone except\nSejanus. He made Sejanus sole prefect of the Praetorian Guard, expanded it\ninto an army of twelve thousand, and gave Sejanus\u2019s men additional roles in\npolicing and administrating the city of Rome. Finally, Sejanus persuaded\nTiberius to move out of the capital to Capri, arguing that it would be much\neasier to protect the emperor on a small island than in a crowded metropolis\nfull of traitors and spies. In truth, explained the Roman historian Tacitus,\nSejanus\u2019s aim was to control all the information reaching the emperor:\n\u201cAccess to the emperor would be under his own control, and letters, for the\nmost part being conveyed by soldiers, would pass through his hands.\u201d13\nWith the Praetorians controlling Rome, Tiberius isolated in Capri, and\nSejanus controlling all information reaching Tiberius, the Praetorian\ncommander became the true ruler of the empire. Sejanus purged anyone\nwho might oppose him\u2014including members of the imperial family\u2014by\nfalsely accusing them of treason. Since nobody could contact the emperor\nwithout Sejanus\u2019s permission, Tiberius was reduced to a puppet.\nEventually someone\u2014perhaps Tiberius\u2019s sister-in-law Antonia\u2014located"}

If he tried\nto make a move, Sejanus could imprison him on Capri indefinitely and\ninform the Senate and the army that the emperor was too ill to travel\nanywhere.\nTiberius nevertheless managed to turn the tables on Sejanus.

Or, they could build a human institution to supervise the AI, but that\ninstitution might limit their own power, too.\nIf even just a few of the world\u2019s dictators choose to put their trust in AI,\nthis could have far-reaching consequences for the whole of humanity.\nScience fiction is full of scenarios of an AI getting out of control and\nenslaving or eliminating humankind. Most sci-fi plots explore these\nscenarios in the context of democratic capitalist societies. This is\nunderstandable.

The same was true of most other early railway lines in the U.K.,\nthe United States, France, Germany, and elsewhere. At that point, it wasn\u2019t\nat all clear why governments or armies should get involved in such\ncommercial enterprises.\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, however, the governments and\narmed forces of the leading industrial powers had fully recognized the\nimmense geopolitical potential of modern industrial technology. The need\nfor raw materials and markets justified imperialism, while industrial\ntechnologies made imperial conquests easier. Steamships were crucial, for\nexample, to the British victory over the Chinese in the Opium Wars, and\nrailroads played a decisive role in the American expansion west and the\nRussian expansion east and south. Indeed, entire imperial projects were\nshaped around the construction of railroads such as the Trans-Siberian and\nTrans-Caspian Russian lines, the German dream of a Berlin-Baghdad\nrailway, and the British dream of building a railway from Cairo to the\nCape.3\nNevertheless, most polities didn\u2019t join the burgeoning industrial arms race"}

Others, like the\nBurmese Empire, the Ashanti Empire, and the Chinese Empire, might have\nhad the capacity but lacked the will and foresight. Their rulers and\ninhabitants either didn\u2019t follow developments in places like the British\nMidlands or didn\u2019t think they had much to do with them. Why should the\nrice farmers of the Irrawaddy basin in Burma or the Yangtze basin in China\nconcern themselves about the Liverpool\u2013Manchester Railway? By the end\nof the nineteenth century, however, these rice farmers found themselves\neither conquered or indirectly exploited by the British Empire. Most other\nstragglers in the industrial race also ended up dominated by one industrial\npower or other. Could something similar happen with AI?\nWhen the race to develop AI gathered steam in the early years of the\ntwenty-first century, it too was initially spearheaded by private\nentrepreneurs in a handful of countries. They set their sights on centralizing\nthe world\u2019s flow of information. Google wanted to organize all the world\u2019s\ninformation in one place. Amazon sought to centralize all the world\u2019s\nshopping. Facebook wished to connect all the world\u2019s social spheres. But\nconcentrating all the world\u2019s information is neither practical nor helpful\nunless one can centrally process that information. And in 2000, when\nGoogle\u2019s search engine was making its baby steps, when Amazon was a\nmodest online bookshop, and when Mark Zuckerberg was in high school,\nthe AI necessary to centrally process oceans of data was nowhere at hand.\nBut some people bet it was just around the corner.\nKevin Kelly, the founding editor of Wired magazine, recounted how in\n2002 he attended a small party at Google and struck up a conversation with\nLarry Page. \u201cLarry, I still don\u2019t get it. There are so many search companies.\nWeb search, for free? Where does that get you?\u201d Page explained that\nGoogle wasn\u2019t focused on search at all. \u201cWe\u2019re really making an AI,\u201d he\nsaid.4 Having lots of data makes it easier to create an AI. And AI can turn\nlots of data into lots of power."}

And like every revolution, a few of these steps were seen\nas turning points, just like the opening of the Liverpool\u2013Manchester\nRailway. In the prolific literature on the story of AI, two events pop up\nagain and again. The first occurred when, on September 30, 2012, a\nconvolutional neural network called AlexNet won the ImageNet Large\nScale Visual Recognition Challenge.\nIf you have no idea what a convolutional neural network is, and if you\nhave never heard of the ImageNet challenge, you are not alone. More than\n99 percent of us are in the same situation, which is why AlexNet\u2019s victory\nwas hardly front-page news in 2012. But some humans did hear about\nAlexNet\u2019s victory and decoded the writing on the wall.\nThey knew, for example, that ImageNet is a database of millions of\nannotated digital images. Did a website ever ask you to prove that you are\nnot a robot by looking at a set of images and indicating which ones contain\na car or a cat? The images you clicked were perhaps added to the ImageNet\ndatabase. The same thing might also have happened to tagged images of\nyour pet cat that you uploaded online. The ImageNet Large Scale Visual\nRecognition Challenge tests various algorithms on how well they are able to\nidentify the annotated images in the database. Can they correctly identify\nthe cats? When humans are asked to do it, out of one hundred cat images we\ncorrectly identify ninety-five as cats. In 2010 the best algorithms had a\nsuccess rate of only 72 percent. In 2011 the algorithmic success rate\ncrawled up to 75 percent. In 2012 the AlexNet algorithm won the challenge\nand stunned the still minuscule community of AI experts by achieving a\nsuccess rate of 85 percent. While this improvement may not sound like\nmuch to laypersons, it demonstrated to the experts the potential for rapid\nprogress in certain AI domains. By 2015 a Microsoft algorithm achieved 96\npercent accuracy, surpassing the human ability to identify cat images.\nIn 2016, The Economist published a piece titled \u201cFrom Not Working to"}

The AI race was on, and the competitors were\nrunning on cat images. At the same time that AlexNet was preparing for the\nImageNet challenge, Google too was training its AI on cat images, and even\ncreated a dedicated cat-image-generating AI called the Meow Generator.6\nThe technology developed by recognizing cute kittens was later deployed\nfor more predatory purposes. For example, Israel relied on it to create the\nRed Wolf, Blue Wolf, and Wolf Pack apps used by Israeli soldiers for facial\nrecognition of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.7 The ability to\nrecognize cat images also led to the algorithms Iran uses to automatically\nrecognize unveiled women and enforce its hijab laws. As explained in\nchapter 8, massive amounts of data are required to train machine-learning\nalgorithms. Without millions of cat images uploaded and annotated for free\nby people across the world, it would not have been possible to train the\nAlexNet algorithm or the Meow Generator, which in turn served as the\ntemplate for subsequent AIs with far-reaching economic, political, and\nmilitary potential.8\nJust as in the early nineteenth century the effort to build railways was\npioneered by private entrepreneurs, so in the early twenty-first century\nprivate corporations were the initial main competitors in the AI race. The\nexecutives of Google, Facebook, Alibaba, and Baidu saw the value of\nrecognizing cat images before the presidents and generals did.

In March 2016, or so the mythology\nof AI would have it, the Chinese government realized that the age of AI had\nbegun.9\nIt is little wonder that the Chinese government was probably the first to\nunderstand the full importance of what was happening. In the nineteenth\ncentury, China was late to appreciate the potential of the Industrial\nRevolution and was slow to adopt inventions like railroads and steamships.\nIt consequently suffered what the Chinese call \u201cthe century of\nhumiliations.\u201d After having been the world\u2019s greatest superpower for\ncenturies, failing to adopt modern industrial technology brought China to its\nknees.

The prize\nfor the winner? World domination.\nDATA COLONIALISM\nIn the sixteenth century, when Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch\nconquistadors were building the first global empires in history, they came\nwith sailing ships, horses, and gunpowder. When the British, Russians, and\nJapanese made their bids for hegemony in the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies, they relied on steamships, locomotives, and machine guns. In the\ntwenty-first century, to dominate a colony, you no longer need to send in the\ngunboats. You need to take out the data. A few corporations or governments\nharvesting the world\u2019s data could transform the rest of the globe into data\ncolonies\u2014territories they control not with overt military force but with\ninformation.14\nImagine a situation\u2014in twenty years, say\u2014when somebody in Beijing or\nSan Francisco possesses the entire personal history of every politician,\njournalist, colonel, and CEO in your country: every text they ever sent,\nevery web search they ever made, every illness they suffered, every sexual\nencounter they enjoyed, every joke they told, every bribe they took. Would\nyou still be living in an independent country, or would you now be living in\na data colony? What happens when your country finds itself utterly\ndependent on digital infrastructures and AI-powered systems over which it\nhas no effective control?"}
{"page": 399, "content": "Such a situation can lead to a new kind of data colonialism in which\ncontrol of data is used to dominate faraway colonies. Mastery of AI and\ndata could also give the new empires control of people\u2019s attention. As we\nhave already discussed, in the 2010s American social media giants like\nFacebook and YouTube upended the politics of distant countries like\nMyanmar and Brazil in pursuit of profit. Future digital empires may do\nsomething similar for political interests.\nFears of psychological warfare, data colonialism, and loss of control over\ntheir cyberspace have led many countries to already block what they see as\ndangerous apps. China has banned Facebook, YouTube, and many other\nWestern social media apps and websites. Russia has banned almost all\nWestern social media apps as well as some Chinese ones.

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, if you were a\ncolony of an industrial power like Belgium or Britain, it usually meant that\nyou provided raw materials, while the cutting-edge industries that made the\nbiggest profits remained in the imperial hub. Egypt exported cotton to\nBritain and imported high-end textiles. Malaya provided rubber for tires;\nCoventry made the cars.18\nSomething analogous is likely to happen with data colonialism. The raw\nmaterial for the AI industry is data. To produce AI that recognizes images,\nyou need cat photos. To produce the trendiest fashion, you need data on\nfashion trends. To produce autonomous vehicles, you need data about traffic\npatterns and car accidents. To produce health-care AI, you need data about\ngenes and medical conditions. In a new imperial information economy, raw\ndata will be harvested throughout the world and will flow to the imperial\nhub. There the cutting-edge technology will be developed, producing\nunbeatable algorithms that know how to identify cats, predict fashion\ntrends, drive autonomous vehicles, and diagnose diseases. These algorithms\nwill then be exported back to the data colonies. Data from Egypt and\nMalaysia might make a corporation in San Francisco or Beijing rich, while\npeople in Cairo and Kuala Lumpur remain poor, because neither the profits\nnor the power is distributed back.\nThe nature of the new information economy might make the imbalance\nbetween imperial hub and exploited colony worse than ever. In ancient\ntimes land\u2014rather than information\u2014was the most important economic\nasset. This precluded the overconcentration of all wealth and power in a\nsingle hub. As long as land was paramount, considerable wealth and power\nalways remained in the hands of provincial landowners. A Roman emperor,\nfor example, could put down one provincial revolt after another, but on the"}

In the Roman Empire, although Italy was the seat of political power,\nthe richest provinces were in the eastern Mediterranean. It was impossible\nto transport the fertile fields of the Nile valley to the Italian Peninsula.19\nEventually the emperors abandoned the city of Rome to the barbarians and\nmoved the seat of political power to the rich east, to Constantinople.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution machines became more important than\nland. Factories, mines, railroad lines, and electrical power stations became\nthe most valuable assets. It was somewhat easier to concentrate these kinds\nof assets in one place. The British Empire could centralize industrial\nproduction in its home islands, extract raw materials from India, Egypt, and\nIraq, and sell them finished goods made in Birmingham or Belfast. Unlike\nin the Roman Empire, Britain was the seat of both political and economic\npower. But physics and geology still put natural limits on this concentration\nof wealth and power. The British couldn\u2019t move every cotton mill from\nCalcutta to Manchester, nor shift the oil wells from Kirkuk to Yorkshire.\nInformation is different. Unlike cotton and oil, digital data can be sent\nfrom Malaysia or Egypt to Beijing or San Francisco at almost the speed of\nlight. And unlike land, oil fields, or textile factories, algorithms don\u2019t take\nup much space. Consequently, unlike industrial power, the world\u2019s\nalgorithmic power can be concentrated in a single hub. Engineers in a\nsingle country might write the code and control the keys for all the crucial\nalgorithms that run the entire world.\nIndeed, AI makes it possible to concentrate in one place even the decisive\nassets of some traditional industries, like textile. In the nineteenth century,\nto control the textile industry meant to control sprawling cotton fields and\nhuge mechanical production lines. In the twenty-first century, the most\nimportant asset of the textile industry is information rather than cotton or\nmachinery.

By controlling this type of information,\nhigh-tech giants like Amazon and Alibaba can monopolize even a very\ntraditional industry like textile.

What will happen to the economies and\npolitics of Pakistan and Bangladesh, for example, when automation makes\nit cheaper to produce textiles in Europe? Consider that at present the textile\nsector provides employment to 40 percent of Pakistan\u2019s total labor force and\naccounts for 84 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s export earnings.21 As noted in\nchapter 7, while automation might make millions of textile workers\nredundant, it will probably create many new jobs, too. For instance, there\nmight be a huge demand for coders and data analysts. But turning an\nunemployed factory hand into a data analyst demands a substantial up-front\ninvestment in retraining. Where would Pakistan and Bangladesh get the\nmoney to do that?\nAI and automation therefore pose a particular challenge to poorer\ndeveloping countries. In an AI-driven economy, the digital leaders claim the\nbulk of the gains and could use their wealth to retrain their workforce and\nprofit even more. Meanwhile, the value of unskilled laborers in left-behind\ncountries will decline, and they will not have the resources to retrain their\nworkforce, causing them to fall even further behind. The result might be\nlots of new jobs and immense wealth in San Francisco and Shanghai, while\nmany other parts of the world face economic ruin.22 According to the global\naccounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, AI is expected to add $15.7\ntrillion to the global economy by 2030.

In the time\nof Jesus, many Jews believed that when the Messiah finally comes, the\nbodies of the dead would come back to life, here on earth. The Kingdom of\nGod, established by the Messiah, was supposed to be a material kingdom,\nwith trees and stones and flesh-and-blood bodies.32\nThis was also the view of Jesus himself and the first Christians. Jesus\npromised his followers that soon the Kingdom of God would be built here\non earth and they would inhabit it in their material bodies. When Jesus died\nwithout fulfilling his promise, his early followers came to believe that he\nwas resurrected in the flesh and that when the Kingdom of God finally\nmaterialized on earth, they too would be resurrected in the flesh. The church\nfather Tertullian (160\u2013240 CE) wrote that \u201cthe flesh is the very condition on\nwhich salvation hinges,\u201d and the catechism of the Catholic Church, citing\nthe doctrines adopted at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, states, \u201cWe\nbelieve in God who is creator of the flesh; we believe in the Word made\nflesh in order to redeem the flesh; we believe in the resurrection of the\nflesh, the fulfillment of both the creation and the redemption of the\nflesh.\u2026 We believe in the true resurrection of this flesh that we now\npossess.\u201d33\nDespite such seemingly unequivocal statements, we saw that Saint Paul\nalready had his doubts about the flesh, and by the fourth century CE, under\nGreek, Manichaean, and Persian influences, some Christians had drifted\ntoward a dualistic approach.

Saints, hermits, and monks made\nbreathtaking experiments in pushing the human body to its limits. Just as\nChrist allowed his body to be tortured on the cross, so these \u201cathletes of\nChrist\u201d allowed lions and bears to rip them apart while their souls rejoiced\nin divine ecstasy. They wore hair shirts, fasted for weeks, or stood for years\non a pillar\u2014like the famous Simeon who allegedly stood for about forty\nyears on top of a pillar near Aleppo.35\nOther Christians took the opposite approach, believing that the body\ndidn\u2019t matter at all. The only thing that mattered was faith. This idea was\ntaken to extremes by Protestants like Martin Luther, who formulated the\ndoctrine of sola fide: only faith. After living as a monk for about ten years,\nfasting and torturing his body in various ways, Luther despaired of these\nbodily exercises. He reasoned that no bodily self-torments could force God\nto redeem him. Indeed, thinking he could win his own salvation by torturing\nhis body was the sin of pride. Luther therefore disrobed, married a former\nnun, and told his followers that to be good Christians, the only thing they\nneeded was to have complete faith in Christ.36\nThese ancient theological debates about mind and body may seem utterly\nirrelevant to the AI revolution, but they have in fact been resurrected by\ntwenty-first-century technologies.

I just order takeout. If you are like ancient Jews and the first\nChristians, you would pity me and conclude that I must be living in a\ndelusion, losing touch with the reality of physical spaces and flesh-and-\nblood bodies. But if your thinking is closer to that of Luther and many later\nChristians, you might think I am liberated. By shifting most of my activities\nand relationships online, I have released myself from the limited organic\nworld of debilitating gravity and corrupt bodies and can enjoy the unlimited\npossibilities of a digital world, which is potentially liberated from the laws\nof biology and even physics. I am free to roam a much vaster and more\nexciting space and to explore new aspects of my identity.\nAn increasingly important question is whether people can adopt any\nvirtual identity they like, or should their identity be constrained by their\nbiological body? If we follow the Lutheran position of sola fide, the\nbiological body isn\u2019t of much importance. To adopt a certain online identity,\nthe only thing that matters is what you believe. This debate can have far-\nreaching consequences not just for human identity but for our attitude to the\nworld as a whole. A society that understands identities in terms of biological\nbodies should also care more about material infrastructure like sewage\npipes and about the ecosystem that sustains our bodies.

Its aim would\nbe to create an ideal physical and biological realm\u2014the Kingdom of God\non earth.

A twenty-first-century controversy about the mind-\nbody problem could result in cultural and political splits more consequential\neven than the split between Jews and Christians or between Catholics and\nProtestants. What happens, for example, if the American sphere discounts\nthe body, defines humans by their online identity, recognizes AIs as persons,\nand downplays the importance of the ecosystem, whereas the Chinese\nsphere adopts opposite positions?

It is unclear whether this will somewhat\nalleviate or only exacerbate the imperial competition.\nThe more the new empires compete against one another, the greater the\ndanger of armed conflict. The Cold War between the United States and the\nU.S.S.R. never escalated into a direct military confrontation largely thanks\nto the doctrine of mutually assured destruction. But the danger of escalation\nin the age of AI is bigger, because cyber warfare is inherently different from\nnuclear warfare.\nFirst, cyber weapons are much more versatile than nuclear bombs. Cyber\nweapons can bring down a country\u2019s electric grid, but they can also be used\nto destroy a secret research facility, jam an enemy sensor, inflame a political\nscandal, manipulate elections, or hack a single smartphone. And they can do\nall that stealthily. They don\u2019t announce their presence with a mushroom\ncloud and a storm of fire, nor do they leave a visible trail from launchpad to\ntarget. Consequently, at times it is hard to know if an attack even occurred\nor who launched it. If a database is hacked or sensitive equipment is\ndestroyed, it\u2019s hard to be sure whom to blame. The temptation to start a\nlimited cyberwar is therefore big, and so is the temptation to escalate it.\nRival countries like Israel and Iran or the United States and Russia have\nbeen trading cyber blows for years, in an undeclared but escalating war.38\nThis is becoming the new global norm, amplifying international tensions\nand pushing countries to cross one red line after another.\nA second crucial difference concerns predictability. The Cold War was like\na hyperrational chess game, and the certainty of destruction in the event of\nnuclear conflict was so great that the desire to start a war was\ncorrespondingly small. Cyber warfare lacks this certainty. Nobody knows\nfor sure where each side has planted its logic bombs, Trojan horses, and\nmalwares. Nobody can be certain whether their own weapons would\nactually work when called upon. Would Chinese missiles fire when the"}

Even worse, if one side\nthinks it has such an opportunity, the temptation to launch a first strike\ncould become irresistible, because one never knows how long the window\nof opportunity will remain open. Game theory posits that the most\ndangerous situation in an arms race is when one side feels it has an\nadvantage but that this advantage is slipping away.40\nEven if humanity avoids the worst-case scenario of global war, the rise of\nnew digital empires could still endanger the freedom and prosperity of\nbillions of people. The industrial empires of the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies exploited and repressed their colonies, and it would be foolhardy\nto expect the new digital empires to behave much better. Moreover, as noted\nearlier, if the world is divided into rival empires, humanity is unlikely to\ncooperate effectively to overcome the ecological crisis or to regulate AI and\nother disruptive technologies like bioengineering.\nTHE GLOBAL BOND\nOf course, no matter whether the world is divided between a few digital\nempires, remains a more diverse community of two hundred nation-states,\nor is split along altogether different and unforeseen lines, cooperation is\nalways an option. Among humans, the precondition for cooperation isn\u2019t\nsimilarity; it is the ability to exchange information. As long as we are able\nto converse, we might find some shared story that can bring us closer.

{"page": 413, "content": "opposing nations and empires can cooperate within a global network. The\nstories that make such cooperation possible do not eliminate our\ndifferences; rather, they enable us to identify shared experiences and\ninterests, which offer a common framework for thought and action.\nA large part of what nevertheless makes global cooperation difficult is the\nmisguided notion that it requires abolishing all cultural, social, and political\ndifferences. Populist politicians often argue that if the international\ncommunity agrees on a common story and on universal norms and values,\nthis will destroy the independence and unique traditions of their own\nnation.41 This position was unabashedly distilled in 2015 by Marine Le Pen\n\u2014leader of France\u2019s National Front party\u2014in an election speech in which\nshe declared, \u201cWe have entered a new two-partyism. A two-partyism\nbetween two mutually exclusive conceptions that will from now on\nstructure our political life. The cleavage no longer separates left and right,\nbut globalists and patriots.\u201d42 In August 2020, President Trump described\nhis guiding ethos thus: \u201cWe have rejected globalism and embraced\npatriotism.\u201d43\nLuckily, this binary position is mistaken in its basic assumption. Global\ncooperation and patriotism are not mutually exclusive. For patriotism isn\u2019t\nabout hating foreigners. It is about loving our compatriots. And there are\nmany situations when, in order to take care of our compatriots, we need to\ncooperate with foreigners. COVID-19 provided us with one obvious\nexample. Pandemics are global events, and without global cooperation it is\nhard to contain them, let alone prevent them. When a new virus or a mutant\npathogen appears in one country, it puts all other countries in danger.\nConversely, the biggest advantage of humans over pathogens is that we can\ncooperate in ways that pathogens cannot. Doctors in Germany and Brazil\ncan alert one another to new dangers, give each other good advice, and\nwork together to discover better treatments.\nIf German scientists invent a vaccine against some new disease, how\nshould Brazilians react to this German achievement? One option is to reject"}

That, however, would be not just foolish; it would be anti-patriotic.\nBrazilian patriots should want to use any available vaccine to help their\ncompatriots, no matter where the vaccine was developed. In this situation,\ncooperating with foreigners is the patriotic thing to do. The threat of losing\ncontrol of AIs is an analogous situation in which patriotism and global\ncooperation must go together. An out-of-control AI, just like an out-of-\ncontrol virus, puts in danger humans in every nation. No human collective\n\u2014whether a tribe, a nation, or the entire species\u2014stands to benefit from\nletting power shift from humans to algorithms.\nContrary to what populists argue, globalism doesn\u2019t mean establishing a\nglobal empire, abandoning national loyalties, or opening borders to\nunlimited immigration. In fact, global cooperation means two far more\nmodest things: first, a commitment to some global rules. These rules don\u2019t\ndeny the uniqueness of each nation and the loyalty people should owe their\nnation. They just regulate the relations between nations. A good model is\nthe World Cup. The World Cup is a competition between nations, and\npeople often show fierce loyalty to their national team. At the same time,\nthe World Cup is an amazing display of global agreement. Brazil cannot\nplay football against Germany unless Brazilians and Germans first agree on\nthe same set of rules for the game. That\u2019s globalism in action.\nThe second principle of globalism is that sometimes\u2014not always, but\nsometimes\u2014it is necessary to prioritize the long-term interests of all\nhumans over the short-term interests of a few. For example, in the World\nCup, all national teams agree not to use performance-enhancing drugs,\nbecause everybody realizes that if they go down that path, the World Cup\nwould eventually devolve into a competition between biochemists. In other\nfields where technology is a game changer, we should similarly strive to\nbalance national and global interests.

While we have\nexperience in regulating dangerous technologies like nuclear and biological\nweapons, the regulation of AI will demand unprecedented levels of trust\nand self-discipline, for two reasons. First, it is easier to hide an illicit AI lab\nthan an illicit nuclear reactor. Second, AIs have a lot more dual civilian-\nmilitary usages than nuclear bombs. Consequently, despite signing an\nagreement that bans autonomous weapon systems, a country could build\nsuch weapons secretly, or camouflage them as civilian products. For\nexample, it might develop fully autonomous drones for delivering mail and\nspraying fields with pesticides that with a few minor modifications could\nalso deliver bombs and spray people with poison. Consequently,\ngovernments and corporations will find it more difficult to trust that their\nrivals are really abiding by the agreed regulations\u2014and to withstand the\ntemptation to themselves waive the rules.44 Can humans develop the\nnecessary levels of trust and self-discipline?

And they are all founded upon a deeper philosophical theory\nof human nature, which the primatologist Frans de Waal termed \u201cveneer\ntheory.\u201d It argues that at heart humans are Stone Age hunters who cannot\nbut see the world as a jungle where the strong prey upon the weak and\nwhere might makes right. For millennia, the theory goes, humans have tried\nto camouflage this unchanging reality under a thin and mutable veneer of\nmyths and rituals, but we have never really broken free from the law of the\njungle. Indeed, our myths and rituals are themselves a weapon used by the\njungle\u2019s top dogs to deceive and trap their inferiors. Those who don\u2019t\nrealize this are dangerously naive and will fall prey to some ruthless\npredator.46\nThere are reasons to think, however, that \u201crealists\u201d like Mearsheimer have\na selective view of historical reality and that the law of the jungle is itself a\nmyth. As de Waal and many other biologists documented in numerous\nstudies, real jungles\u2014unlike the one in our imagination\u2014are full of\ncooperation, symbiosis, and altruism displayed by countless animals, plants,\nfungi, and even bacteria. Eighty percent of all land plants, for example, rely\non symbiotic relationships with fungi, and almost 90 percent of vascular\nplant families enjoy symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. If\norganisms in the rain forests of Amazonia, Africa, or India abandoned\ncooperation in favor of an all-out competition for hegemony, the rain forests\nand all their inhabitants would quickly die. That\u2019s the law of the jungle.47\nAs for Stone Age humans, they were gatherers as well as hunters, and\nthere is no firm evidence that they had irrepressible warlike tendencies.\nWhile there are plenty of speculations, the first unambiguous evidence for"}

Some\nperiods were exceptionally violent, whereas others were relatively peaceful.\nThe clearest pattern we observe in the long-term history of humanity isn\u2019t\nthe constancy of conflict, but rather the increasing scale of cooperation. A\nhundred thousand years ago, Sapiens could cooperate only at the level of\nbands. Over the millennia, we have found ways to create communities of\nstrangers, first on the level of tribes and eventually on the level of religions,\ntrade networks, and states. Realists should note that states are not the\nfundamental particles of human reality, but rather the product of arduous\nprocesses of building trust and cooperation. If humans were interested only\nin power, they could never have created states in the first place. Sure,\nconflicts have always remained a possibility\u2014both between and within\nstates\u2014but they have never been an inescapable destiny.\nWar\u2019s intensity depends not on an immutable human nature but on shifting\ntechnological, economic, and cultural factors.

While it\nhas remained feasible to conquer rice paddies and gold mines, by the late\ntwentieth century these were no longer the main sources of economic\nwealth. The new leading industries, like the semiconductor sector, came to\nbe based on technical skills and organizational know-how that could not be\nacquired by military conquest.

Due to these\ntechnological, economic, and cultural changes, in the decades following the\nend of World War II most governments stopped seeing wars of aggression\nas an appealing tool to advance their interests, and most nations stopped\nfantasizing about conquering and destroying their neighbors.

For most of\nrecorded history, the military was the number one item on the budget of\nevery empire, sultanate, kingdom, and republic. Governments spent little on\nhealth care and education, because most of their resources were consumed\nby paying soldiers, constructing walls, and building warships.

The Roman Empire spent about 50\u201375 percent of its budget\non the military,51 and the figure was about 60 percent in the late\nseventeenth-century Ottoman Empire.52 Between 1685 and 1813 the share"}

In Prussia, from\n1711 to 1800 the military share of the budget never fell below 75 percent\nand occasionally reached as high as 91 percent.54 During the relatively\npeaceful years of 1870\u20131913, the military ate up an average of 30 percent\nof the state budgets of the major powers of Europe, as well as Japan and the\nUnited States, while smaller powers like Sweden were spending even\nmore.55 When war broke out in 1914, military budges skyrocketed.

Annan was advised to speak first, so as\nto prevent the general from monopolizing the conversation, which was\nmeant to last only twenty minutes. But Than Shwe struck first and held\nforth for nearly an hour on the history of Myanmar, hardly giving the UN\nsecretary-general any chance to speak.2 In May 2011 the Israeli prime\nminister, Benjamin Netanyahu did something similar in the White House,\nwhen he met the U.S. president, Barack Obama. After Obama\u2019s brief\nintroductory remarks, Netanyahu subjected the president to a long lecture\nabout the history of Israel and the Jewish people, treating Obama as if he\nwere his student.3 Cynics might argue that Than Shwe and Netanyahu\nhardly cared about the facts of history and were deliberately distorting them\nin order to achieve some political goal. But these political goals were\nthemselves the product of deeply held convictions about history.\nIn my own conversations on AI with politicians, as well as tech"}
{"page": 424, "content": "entrepreneurs, history has often emerged as a central theme. Some of my\ninterlocutors painted a rosy picture of history and were accordingly\nenthusiastic about AI. They argued that more information has always meant\nmore knowledge and that by increasing our knowledge, every previous\ninformation revolution has greatly benefited humankind. Didn\u2019t the print\nrevolution lead to the scientific revolution? Didn\u2019t newspapers and radio\nlead to the rise of modern democracy? The same, they said, would happen\nwith AI. Others had a dimmer perspective, but nevertheless expressed hope\nthat humankind will somehow muddle through the AI revolution, just as we\nmuddled through the Industrial Revolution.\nNeither view offered me much solace. For reasons explained in previous\nchapters, I find such historical comparisons to the print revolution and the\nIndustrial Revolution distressing, especially coming from people in\npositions of power, whose historical vision is informing the decisions that\nshape our future. These historical comparisons underestimate both the\nunprecedented nature of the AI revolution and the negative aspects of\nprevious revolutions. The immediate results of the print revolution included\nwitch hunts and religious wars alongside scientific discoveries, while\nnewspapers and radio were exploited by totalitarian regimes as well as by\ndemocracies. As for the Industrial Revolution, adapting to it involved\ncatastrophic experiments such as imperialism and Nazism. If the AI\nrevolution leads us to similar kinds of experiments, can we really be certain\nwe will muddle through again?\nMy goal with this book is to provide a more accurate historical\nperspective on the AI revolution. This revolution is still in its infancy, and it\nis notoriously difficult to understand momentous developments in real time.\nIt is hard, even now, to assess the meaning of events in the 2010s like\nAlphaGo\u2019s victory or Facebook\u2019s involvement in the anti-Rohingya\ncampaign. The meaning of events of the early 2020s is even more obscure.\nYet by expanding our horizons to look at how information networks\ndeveloped over thousands of years, I believe it is possible to gain some"}
{"page": 425, "content": "insight on what we\u2019re living through today.\nOne lesson is that the invention of new information technology is always a\ncatalyst for major historical changes, because the most important role of\ninformation is to weave new networks rather than represent preexisting\nrealities. By recording tax payments, clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia\nhelped forge the first city-states. By canonizing prophetic visions, holy\nbooks spread new kinds of religions. By swiftly disseminating the words of\npresidents and citizens, newspapers and telegraphs opened the door to both\nlarge-scale democracy and large-scale totalitarianism. The information thus\nrecorded and distributed was sometimes true, often false, but it invariably\ncreated new connections between larger numbers of people.\nWe are used to giving political, ideological, and economic interpretations\nto historical revolutions such as the rise of the first Mesopotamian city-\nstates, the spread of Christianity, the American Revolution, and the\nBolshevik Revolution. But to gain a deeper understanding, we should also\nview them as revolutions in the way information flows. Christianity was\nobviously different from Greek polytheism in many of its myths and rites,\nyet it was also different in the importance it gave to a single holy book and\nthe institution entrusted with interpreting it. Consequently, whereas each\ntemple of Zeus was a separate entity, each Christian church became a node\nin a unified network.4 Information flowed differently among the followers\nof Christ than among the worshippers of Zeus. Similarly, Stalin\u2019s U.S.S.R.\nwas a different kind of information network from Peter the Great\u2019s empire.\nStalin enacted many unprecedented economic policies, but what enabled\nhim to do it is that he headed a totalitarian network in which the center\naccumulated enough information to micromanage the lives of hundreds of\nmillions of people. Technology is rarely deterministic, and the same\ntechnology can be used in very different ways. But without the invention of\ntechnologies like the book and the telegraph, the Christian Church and the\nStalinist apparatus would never have been possible.\nThis historical lesson should strongly encourage us to pay more attention"}
{"page": 426, "content": "to the AI revolution in our current political debates. The invention of AI is\npotentially more momentous than the invention of the telegraph, the\nprinting press, or even writing, because AI is the first tool that is capable of\nmaking decisions and generating ideas by itself. Whereas printing presses\nand parchment scrolls offered new means for connecting people, AIs are\nfull-fledged members in our information networks. In coming years, all\ninformation networks\u2014from armies to religions\u2014will gain millions of new\nAI members, who will process data very differently than humans. These\nnew members will make alien decisions and generate alien ideas\u2014that is,\ndecisions and ideas that are unlikely to occur to humans. The addition of so\nmany alien members is bound to change the shape of armies, religions,\nmarkets, and nations. Entire political, economic, and social systems might\ncollapse, and new ones will take their place. That\u2019s why AI should be a\nmatter of utmost urgency even to people who don\u2019t care about technology\nand who think the most important political questions concern the survival of\ndemocracy or the fair distribution of wealth.\nThis book has juxtaposed the discussion of AI with the discussion of\nsacred canons like the Bible, because we are now at the critical moment of\nAI canonization. When church fathers like Bishop Athanasius decided to\ninclude 1 Timothy in the biblical dataset while excluding the Acts of Paul\nand Thecla, they shaped the world for millennia. Billions of Christians\ndown to the twenty-first century have formed their views of the world based\non the misogynist ideas of 1 Timothy rather than on the more tolerant\nattitude of Thecla. Even today it is difficult to reverse course, because the\nchurch fathers chose not to include any self-correcting mechanisms in the\nBible. The present-day equivalents of Bishop Athanasius are the engineers\nwho write the initial code for AI, and who choose the dataset on which the\nbaby AI is trained. As AI grows in power and authority, and perhaps\nbecomes a self-interpreting holy book, so the decisions made by present-\nday engineers could reverberate down the ages.\nStudying history does more than just emphasize the importance of the AI"}
{"page": 427, "content": "revolution and of our decisions regarding AI. It also cautions us against two\ncommon but misleading approaches to information networks and\ninformation revolutions. On the one hand, we should beware of an overly\nnaive and optimistic view. Information isn\u2019t truth. Its main task is to\nconnect rather than represent, and information networks throughout history\nhave often privileged order over truth. Tax records, holy books, political\nmanifestos, and secret police files can be extremely efficient in creating\npowerful states and churches, which hold a distorted view of the world and\nare prone to abuse their power. More information, ironically, can sometimes\nresult in more witch hunts.\nThere is no reason to expect that AI would necessarily break the pattern\nand privilege truth. AI is not infallible. What little historical perspective we\nhave gained from the alarming events in Myanmar, Brazil, and elsewhere\nover the past decade indicates that in the absence of strong self-correcting\nmechanisms AIs are more than capable of promoting distorted worldviews,\nenabling egregious abuses of power, and instigating terrifying new witch\nhunts.\nOn the other hand, we should also beware of swinging too far in the other\ndirection and adopting an overly cynical view. Populists tell us that power is\nthe only reality, that all human interactions are power struggles, and that\ninformation is merely a weapon we use to vanquish our enemies. This has\nnever been the case, and there is no reason to think that AI will make it so\nin the future. While many information networks do privilege order over\ntruth, no network can survive if it ignores truth completely. As for\nindividual humans, we tend to be genuinely interested in truth rather than\nonly in power. Even institutions like the Spanish Inquisition have had\nconscientious truth-seeking members like Alonso de Salazar Fr\u00edas, who,\ninstead of sending innocent people to their deaths, risked his life to remind\nus that witches are just intersubjective fictions. Most people don\u2019t view\nthemselves as one-dimensional creatures obsessed solely with power. Why,\nthen, hold such a view about everyone else?"}
{"page": 428, "content": "Refusing to reduce all human interactions to a zero-sum power struggle is\ncrucial not just for gaining a fuller, more nuanced understanding of the past\nbut also for having a more hopeful and constructive attitude about our\nfuture. If power were the only reality, then the only way to resolve conflicts\nwould be through violence. Both populists and Marxists believe that\npeople\u2019s views are determined by their privileges, and that to change\npeople\u2019s views it is necessary to first take away their privileges\u2014which\nusually requires force. However, since humans are interested in truth, there\nis a chance to resolve at least some conflicts peacefully, by talking to one\nanother, acknowledging mistakes, embracing new ideas, and revising the\nstories we believe. That is the basic assumption of democratic networks and\nof scientific institutions. It has also been the basic motivation behind\nwriting this book.\nEXTINCTION OF THE SMARTEST\nLet\u2019s return now to the question I posed at the beginning of this book: If we\nare so wise, why are we so self-destructive? We are at one and the same\ntime both the smartest and the stupidest animals on earth. We are so smart\nthat we can produce nuclear missiles and superintelligent algorithms. And\nwe are so stupid that we go ahead producing these things even though we\u2019re\nnot sure we can control them and failing to do so could destroy us. Why do\nwe do it? Does something in our nature compel us to go down the path of\nself-destruction?\nThis book has argued that the fault isn\u2019t with our nature but with our\ninformation networks. Due to the privileging of order over truth, human\ninformation networks have often produced a lot of power but little wisdom.\nFor example, Nazi Germany created a highly efficient military machine and\nplaced it at the service of an insane mythology. The result was misery on an\nenormous scale, the death of tens of millions of people, and eventually the\ndestruction of Nazi Germany, too."}
{"page": 429, "content": "Of course, power is not in itself bad. When used wisely, it can be an\ninstrument of benevolence. Modern civilization, for example, has acquired\nthe power to prevent famines, contain epidemics, and mitigate natural\ndisasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. In general, the acquisition of\npower allows a network to deal more effectively with threats coming from\noutside, but simultaneously increases the dangers that the network poses to\nitself. It is particularly noteworthy that as a network becomes more\npowerful, imaginary terrors that exist only in the stories the network itself\ninvents become potentially more dangerous than natural disasters. A\nmodern state faced with drought or excessive rains can usually prevent this\nnatural disaster from causing mass starvation among its citizens. But a\nmodern state gripped by a man-made fantasy is capable of instigating man-\nmade famines on an enormous scale, as happened in the U.S.S.R. in the\nearly 1930s.\nAccordingly, as a network becomes more powerful, its self-correcting\nmechanisms become more vital. If a Stone Age tribe or a Bronze Age city-\nstate was incapable of identifying and correcting its own mistakes, the\npotential damage was limited. At most, one city was destroyed, and the\nsurvivors tried again elsewhere. Even if the ruler of an Iron Age empire,\nsuch as Tiberius or Nero, was gripped by paranoia or psychosis, the\nconsequences were seldom catastrophic. The Roman Empire endured for\ncenturies despite its fair share of mad emperors, and its eventual collapse\ndid not bring about the end of human civilization. But if a Silicon Age\nsuperpower has weak or nonexistent self-correcting mechanisms, it could\nvery well endanger the survival of our species, and countless other life-\nforms, too. In the era of AI, the whole of humankind finds itself in an\nanalogous situation to Tiberius in his Capri villa. We command immense\npower and enjoy rare luxuries, but we are easily manipulated by our own\ncreations, and by the time we wake up to the danger, it might be too late.\nUnfortunately, despite the importance of self-correcting mechanisms for\nthe long-term welfare of humanity, politicians might be tempted to weaken"}

It could deliver immense power into the hands of\na twenty-first-century Stalin, and it would be foolhardy to assume that an\nAI-enhanced totalitarian regime would necessarily self-destruct before it\ncould wreak havoc on human civilization. Just as the law of the jungle is a\nmyth, so also is the idea that the arc of history bends toward justice. History\nis a radically open arc, one that can bend in many directions and reach very\ndifferent destinations. Even if Homo sapiens destroys itself, the universe\nwill keep going about its business as usual. It took four billion years for\nterrestrial evolution to produce a civilization of highly intelligent apes. If\nwe are gone, and it takes evolution another hundred million years to\nproduce a civilization of highly intelligent rats, it will. The universe is\npatient.\nThere is, though, an even worse scenario. As far as we know today, apes,\nrats, and the other organic animals of planet Earth may be the only\nconscious entities in the entire universe. We have now created a\nnonconscious but very powerful alien intelligence. If we mishandle it, AI\nmight extinguish not only the human dominion on Earth but the light of\nconsciousness itself, turning the universe into a realm of utter darkness. It is\nour responsibility to prevent this.\nThe good news is that if we eschew complacency and despair, we are\ncapable of creating balanced information networks that will keep their own\npower in check. Doing so is not a matter of inventing another miracle\ntechnology or landing upon some brilliant idea that has somehow escaped\nall previous generations. Rather, to create wiser networks, we must abandon\nboth the naive and the populist views of information, put aside our fantasies\nof infallibility, and commit ourselves to the hard and rather mundane work\nof building institutions with strong self-correcting mechanisms.

See, for example, the works of Nick Bostrom and David Chalmers on the simulation hypothesis.\nIf the simulation hypothesis is true, then we have no idea what the universe is ultimately made\nof, but everything we see in our simulated world is made of bits of information. Nick Bostrom,\n\u201cAre We Living in a Computer Simulation?,\u201d Philosophical Quarterly 53, no. 211 (2003): 243\u2013\n55, www.jstor.org/stable/3542867; David J. Chalmers, Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the\nProblems of Philosophy (New York: W. W. Norton, 2022). See also Archibald Wheeler\u2019s\ninfluential notion of \u201cit from bit\u201d: John Archibald Wheeler, \u201cInformation, Physics, Quantum:\nThe Search for Links,\u201d Proceedings III International Symposium on Foundations of Quantum\nMechanics (Tokyo, 1989), 354\u201368; Paul Davies and Niels Henrik Gregersen, eds., Information\nand the Nature of Reality: From Physics to Metaphysics (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2014); Erik Verlinde, \u201cOn the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton,\u201d\nJournal of High Energy Physics 4 (2011): 1\u201327. It should be emphasized that while the \u201cit from\nbit\u201d position is becoming more acceptable in physics, most physicists still doubt or reject it and\nbelieve that matter and energy are the fundamental building blocks of nature, while information\nis a derived phenomenon.\n2. My understanding of information has been deeply influenced by Cesar Hidalgo, Why\nInformation Grows (New York: Basic Books, 2015).

This is the exact opposite of the position taken by early modern\nwitch-hunters, who insisted that such things actually happened and doubting their reality is a\nsin.
